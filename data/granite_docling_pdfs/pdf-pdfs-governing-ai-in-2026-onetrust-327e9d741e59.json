In 2025 alone, more than 3,200 regulatory updates were issued worldwide, with 875 directly related to AI laws and regulations. By the end of the year, 51 AI laws were already in force, 15 had been passed, and 97 more were in progress. In the United States, over 40 states introduced or considered close to 700 AI-related bills1.\n\nThis shift is no longer theoretical. Enforcement activity across privacy and AI is intensifying, with over €2 billion in GDPR enforcement actions in 2025, including some of the largest fines on record. Regulators are now applying similar expectations to AI systems that influence individuals' rights, access, and opportunities.\n\nThis whitepaper examines how global AI regulation applies through 2026, with a focus on what privacy and compliance teams must operationalize today. It translates binding legal obligations into governance actions, using Europe and the United States as anchors, while addressing APAC and Latin America as rapidly maturing enforcement regions.\n\n1 OneTrust 2026 Predictions Report: Into the Age of AI Lessons from the Future\n\n## 1.  The role of privacy and compliance teams in AI Governance\n\nArtificial intelligence now shapes hiring decisions, credit assessments, healthcare access, pricing, content moderation, and public services. As these systems move from experimentation into production, regulators are assessing whether organizations can control risk, explain outcomes, and demonstrate accountability.\n\nAI regulation does not replace privacy law. It extends privacy governance into automated and algorithmic systems that affect individuals at scale. Across jurisdictions, regulators expect organizations to:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Identify where AI is used in decision-making\n- Assess risks to individuals and fundamental rights\n- Provide clear notice when AI influences outcomes\n- Maintain documentation that demonstrates accountability\n- Monitor systems after deployment and respond to incidents\n\nThese expectations closely mirror established privacy program responsibilities. As a result, privacy and compliance teams are increasingly responsible for making AI governance work in practice, even when AI development sits elsewhere in the organization.\n\n## Core regulatory patterns shaping AI governance\n\nAcross jurisdictions, and despite regional differences, binding AI laws follow a common structure:\n\n- Risk-based classification: Most laws distinguish AI systems by impact, not technology. Systems used in employment, credit, healthcare, education, public services, or biometric identification consistently fall into higher-risk categories and trigger additional obligations.\n- Role-based accountability: Regulators assign responsibilities across the AI lifecycle. Developers, deployers, distributors, and providers each carry distinct duties. This mirrors controller-processor models under privacy law and requires clear internal role definition.\n- Accountability through evidence: Documentation, logging, assessments, and monitoring are treated as proof that governance exists in practice. Regulators increasingly view the absence of documentation as evidence of noncompliance.\n\nFor privacy teams, these requirements are not unfamiliar. They extend existing governance practices into AI-driven decision-making and automated systems.\n\n## 2. Europe: Enforcement-ready AI governance\n\n## Regulatory overview\n\nThe EU Artificial Intelligence Act is the most comprehensive AI regulation currently in force. Its risk-based model classifies systems as unacceptable risk, high risk, specific transparency risk, and limited risk, with obligations scaling accordingly.\n\nIt entered into force in August 2024, with obligations phasing in through 2027. By 2026, organizations will already be expected to comply with:\n\n- Prohibitions on certain AI practices\n- Transparency obligations for AI interactions\n- Governance requirements for general-purpose AI models\n- Penalty provisions enforced by national authorities and the EU AI Office\n\nHigh-risk AI systems must undergo pre-deployment assessments, maintain technical documentation, log system activity, and support post-market monitoring. Deployers must assess impacts on fundamental rights, reinforcing existing DPIA practices under GDPR.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key obligations by actor\n\n| Actor        | Core obligations                                                                            |\n|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Providers    | Technical documentation, conformity assessments, post-market monitoring, incident reporting |\n| Deployers    | Fundamental rights impact assessments, usage controls, monitoring                           |\n| Distributors | Verification of conformity and documentation                                                |\n\n## Operational implications for privacy teams\n\nPrivacy teams are often responsible for:\n\n- Integrating AI risk assessments with DPIA workflows\n- Supporting fundamental rights impact assessments\n- Maintaining documentation repositories\n- Coordinating responses to regulator inquiries\n\n## The role of the EU Digital Omnibus\n\nThe Digital Omnibus proposal introduced in late 2025 seeks to align the GDPR, the AI Act, and ePrivacy obligations. It proposes adjustments to definitions of personal data, data subject rights, and legitimate interest, including broader flexibility for AI training.\n\nWhile still under debate, the Omnibus reflects a shift in regulatory posture. European regulators are looking to simplify compliance mechanics without stepping back from oversight. For privacy teams, this suggests continued scrutiny of automated decision-making, profiling, and transparency, even as operational details evolve.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3. United States: State-led AI enforcement\n\nIn the absence of a federal AI statute, US states are defining enforceable standards through consumer protection and civil rights frameworks.\n\nCalifornia, Colorado, and Texas are setting expectations around:\n\n- Disclosure when individuals interact with AI\n- Documentation of AI system purpose and limitations\n- Controls to prevent discriminatory outcomes\n- Oversight tied to existing enforcement authorities\n\n## Key laws effective in 2026\n\n| State      | Law                              | Effective date   | Focus                        |\n|------------|----------------------------------|------------------|------------------------------|\n| California | AI TransparencyAct               | Jan 1, 2026      | Disclosure, content labeling |\n| California | GenAITrainingDataTransparencyAct | Jan 1, 2026      | Dataset transparency         |\n| Colorado   | AI Act                           | Jun 30, 2026     | Algorithmic discrimination   |\n| Texas      | Responsible AI Governance Act    | Jan 1, 2026      | Prohibited practices         |\n\nThese laws emphasize disclosure when individuals interact with AI, documentation of system purpose and limitations, and safeguards against discriminatory outcomes. Legislation also heavily focuses on specific use cases of AI, such as consumer transactions, healthcare, and deepfakes. Enforcement relies on existing authorities such as state attorneys general, with penalties tied to ongoing violations.\n\n## Operational implications for privacy teams\n\nPrivacy teams must ensure AI notices align with consumer privacy disclosures, rights request workflows accommodate AIdriven decisions, and documentation supports reasonable care defenses under state enforcement models.\n\n## 4. Asia-Pacific: Binding rules and early enforcement\n\nSeveral APAC jurisdictions have already moved beyond voluntary guidance and operate under binding AI frameworks.\n\nSouth Korea's Basic AI Act enters into force on January 22, 2026. It applies extraterritorially where systems affect Korean\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nusers and introduces requirements for transparency, risk assessment, human oversight, and documentation, particularly for high-impact and large-scale AI systems. A draft enforcement decree published in September 2025 clarifies watermarking, disclosure, and oversight obligations.\n\nChina enforces multiple AI regulations, including the Generative AI Services Management Measures and Measures for the Identification of Synthetic Content Generated by AI effective September 1, 2025.\n\nThese laws impose obligations around consent, data quality, content labeling, user rights, and complaint handling.\n\nJapan relies on a principles-based AI Act emphasizing cooperation and transparency rather than penalties. Vietnam's Law on Digital Technology introduces binding AI provisions effective in 2026, with a comprehensive AI Law entering into force on March 1, 2026, which includes labeling, transparency, and prohibitions tied to human rights and public order.\n\nAcross the region, AI governance is increasingly linked to data protection, security, and rights-based oversight.\n\n## Comparative overview\n\n| Jurisdiction   | Law                      | Status        | Key focus                      |\n|----------------|--------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------|\n| China          | GenAI Services Measures  | In force      | Consent, labeling, user rights |\n| China          | SyntheticContentMeasures | Sep 1, 2025   | Content identification         |\n| South Korea    | Basic AI Act             | Jan 22, 2026  | High-impact AI governance      |\n| Vietnam        | LawonAI                  | March 1, 2026 | Transparency, prohibitions     |\n| Japan          | AI Act                   | In force      | Principles-based governance    |\n\n## Operational implications for privacy teams\n\nPrivacy teams operating in APAC must manage overlapping AI, data protection, and content obligations, maintain localized documentation, and support user rights and complaint mechanisms embedded in AI regulations.\n\n## 5. Latin America: Brazil's AI framework takes shape\n\nBrazil is positioning itself as a leading AI regulator in Latin America. Bill No. 2338, approved by the Senate in December 2024 and awaiting final approval, introduces a comprehensive, risk-based AI framework aligned with the EU AI Act.\n\nIf enacted, organizations would need to support impact assessments, incident reporting, transparency obligations, and individual rights to contest AI-driven decisions, request human review, and seek correction of discriminatory outcomes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Operational implications for privacy teams\n\nBrazil's framework places privacy teams at the center of AI governance by embedding rights-based protections, assessment requirements, and accountability mechanisms directly into AI regulation.\n\n## 6. How to operationalize AI-readiness\n\nEffective AI-readiness requires extending privacy operations, not rebuilding them from scratch. Organizations need the ability to inventory AI systems, connect risk assessments to product changes, manage disclosures consistently, and maintain evidence across jurisdictions.\n\nIn practice, this means replacing fragmented spreadsheets and ad hoc reviews with workflows that embed assessment, documentation, monitoring, and response into day-to-day operations. Privacy teams benefit from centralized visibility into AI use cases, integrated assessment processes aligned with\n\nDPIAs, automated tracking of regulatory changes, and scalable handling of rights and incident requests tied to AI-driven outcomes.\n\nWhen governance is operationalized, teams spend less time chasing information and more time managing risk proactively. This reduces regulatory exposure while enabling responsible AI deployment at speed.\n\n## Governance as an enabler through 2026\n\nKey AI regulatory milestones through 2026 include the phased application of the EU AI Act, the entry into force of multiple US state AI laws on January 1 and June 30, 2026, South Korea's Basic AI Act on January 22, 2026, and binding AI provisions across APAC and Latin America.\n\nOrganizations that reach these milestones with mature privacy programs in place will be better positioned to adapt. A wellrun privacy function provides the structure AI governance now demands: clear ownership, documented assessments, transparent communication, and continuous monitoring.\n\nAs AI regulation moves deeper into enforcement, privacy becomes more than a compliance requirement. It becomes an enabler for innovation, allowing organizations to deploy AI responsibly, earn trust, and scale with confidence across global markets.\n\n## Assess your AI governance readiness for 2026.\n\nExolore our integrated privacy solutions to evaluate current privacy and AI controls against emerging regulatory expectations and identify operational gaps.\n\nLearn more\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Appendix - Regional regulatory comparison table\n\n| Region         | Law                                                                               | Effective timeline                                                           | Scope                                                                        | Key focus areas                                                                       | Enforcement                                                               |\n|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| European Union | In force August2024, phased application through2027 EUArtificial Intelligence Act | Extraterritorial.
