SP800-160 anonymization The process in which individually identifiable data is altered in such a way that it no longer can be related back to a given individual. Among many techniques, there are three primary ways that data is anonymized. Suppression is the most basic version of anonymization and it simply removes some identifying values from data to reduce its identifiability. Generalization takes specific identifying values and makes them broader, such as changing a specific age (18) to an age range (18-24). Noise addition takes identifying values from a given data set and switches them with identifying values from another individual in that data set. Note that all of these processes will not guarantee that data is no longer identifiable and have to be performed in such a way that does not harm the usability of the data.

Further, modeling methods based on interpolators (especially kriging) emerge as a viable approach. Good practice is to use Latin hypercubes for computer experiments, and advanced nonparametric modeling methods such as kriging, neural networks, and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) in the data analysis stage. Important applications of computer experimental methods are for determining process optima and for evaluating process tolerances. nist_statistics _2012 expert system A form of AI that attempts to replicate a human's expertise in an area, such as medical diagnosis.

APA_external_ validity facial recognition (FR) Face recognition algorithms, however, have no built-in notion of a particular person. They are not built to identify particular people; instead they include a face detector followed by a feature extraction algorithm that converts one or more images of a person into a vector of values that relate to the identity of the person. The extractor typically consists of a neural network that has been trained on ID-labeled images available to the developer. In operations, they act as generic extractors of identity-related information from photos of persons they have usually never seen before. Recognition proceeds as a differential operator: Algorithms compare two feature vectors and emit a similarity score. This is a vendor-defined numeric value expressing how similar the parent faces are. It is compared to a threshold value to decide whether two samples are from, or represent, the same person or not. Thus, recognition is mediated by persistent identity information stored in a feature vector (or “template”). NISTIR_8280 fairness metric A quantification of unwanted bias in training data or models.

Naïvely, the simplest test would be to check if the marginal distributions have changed for each feature (as explored by [25]); however, the marginal distribution would be easy for an adversary to simulate (e.g., by looping the sensor values from a previous day). Thus, marginal tests are not sufficient for our purpose. Therefore, we propose to use conditional distribution tests. More formally, our null and alternative hypothesis for the j-th feature is that its full conditional distribution (i.e., its distribution given all other features) has not shifted for all values of the other features. kulinski_featur e_2020 federated learning An approach to machine learning which addresses problems of data governance and privacy by training algorithms collaboratively without transferring the data to a central location.

Generative modeling is an unsupervised learning task in machine learning that involves automatically discovering and learning the regularities or patterns in input data in such a way that the model can be used to generate or output new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from the original dataset. Brownlee, _Jason A pair of jointly trained neural networks that generates realistic new data and improves through competition. One net creates new examples (fake Picassos, say) as the other tries to detect the fakes. Hutson, _Matthew Generative adversarial networks (GANs) consist of two competing neural networks—a generator network that tries to create fake outputs (such as pictures), and a discriminator network that tries to determine whether the outputs are real or fake. A major advantage of this structure is that GANs can learn from less data than other deep learning algorithms. CRS_AI An approach to training AI models useful for applications like data synthesis, augmentation, and compression where two neural networks are trained in tandem: one is designed to be a generative network (the forger) and the other a discriminative network (the forgery detector).

Leavy_OHQR_ Intro Qualitative measurement engages research methods and techniques to provide information about the nature of phenomenon. Qualitative methods are designed for systematic collection, organization, description and interpretation of non-numeric (textual, verbal or visual) data (Hammarberg et. al, 2016). Qualitative measurement generally answers questions about why, for whom, when, and how something is (or is not) observed, whereas quantitative measurement answers questions about what is observed. Elements assessed using qualitative measurement may include contextual norms or meaning, socio-cultural dynamics, individual or collective beliefs, and complex multi-component interactions or interventions (Busetto et. al, 2020). Hammarberg_ 2016_Busetto_ 2020 Documentation of assumptions and methods used is a foundational element of qualitative measurement, as the choice of single or combined methods is made based on the phenomenon and its context (Russell & Gregory, 2003). When appropriately paired, qualitative and quantitative measurement can provide corroboration or elaboration, demonstrate use cases, and/or identify conditions for complementarity or contradiction (Brannen, 2005).

However, organisations must comply with the minimisation principle under data protection law if using personal data. This means ensuring that any personal data is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. […] The default approach of data scientists in designing and building AI systems will not necessarily take into account any data minimisation constraints.

Here, the learned model is treated as a black box and its predictions are altered by a function during the post-processing phase. The function is deduced from the performance of the black box model on the holdout dataset. SP1270 Performed after training by accessing a holdout set that was not involved during the training of the model. If the algorithm can only treat the learned model as a black box without any ability to modify the training data or learning algorithm, then only post-processing can be used in which the labels assigned by the black-box model initially get reassigned based on a function during the post-processing phase. Mehrabi, _Ninareh Steps performed after a machine learning model has been run to adjust its output.
