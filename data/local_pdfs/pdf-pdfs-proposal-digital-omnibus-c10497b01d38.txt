Proposal for a 

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL 

amending Regulations (EU) 2024/1689 and (EU) 2018/1139 as regards the simplification 

of the implementation of harmonised rules on artificial intelligence (Digital Omnibus on

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 

1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL 

• Reasons for and objectives of the proposal 

In its Communication on a Simpler and Faster Europe ( 1), the Commission announced its commitment to an ambitious programme to promote forward-looking, innovative policies that strengthen the European Union’s (EU) competitiveness and lighten the regulatory burdens on people, businesses and administrations, while maintaining the highest standard in promoting its values. 

Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 June 2024 laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence (‘AI Act’), which entered into force on 1 August 2024, establishes a single market for trustworthy and human-centric artificial intelligence (‘AI’) across the EU. Its purpose is to promote innovation and the uptake of AI while ensuring a high level of protection for health, safety, and fundamental rights, including democracy and the rule of law. 

The AI Act’s entry into application occurs in stages, with all rules entering into application by 2 August 2027. The prohibitions on AI practices with unacceptable risks and the obligations for general-purpose AI models are already applicable. However, most provisions – in particular those governing high-risk AI systems – will only start to apply from 2 August 2026 or 2 August 2027. These provisions include detailed requirements for data governance, transparency, documentation, human oversight, and robustness, so as to ensure that AI systems placed on the EU market are safe, transparent, and reliable. 

The Commission is committed to a clear, simple, and innovation-friendly implementation of the AI Act, as set out in the AI Continent Action Plan (2) and the Apply AI Strategy (3). Initiatives such as the General-Purpose AI Code of Practice, Commission guidelines and templates, the AI Pact and the launch of the AI Act Service Desk build clarity regarding the applicable rules and support for their application. In particular, the website through which the AI Act Service Desk is provided offers a single information platform ( 4) on all resources available to stakeholders to navigate the AI Act, including guidelines, national authorities and support initiatives, webinars, and harmonised standards. These efforts will continue, with further guidance and digital tools under preparation. 

Building on experience gained from the implementation of already applicable provisions, the Commission held a series of consultations, including a public consultation to identify potential challenges with implementing the AI Act’s provisions, a call for evidence in preparation of the Digital Omnibus, a reality check allowing stakeholders to directly share their implementation experiences and an SME panel to identify their particular needs in the implementation of the AI Act.

# EN 2 EN 

These consultations reveal implementation challenges that could jeopardise the effective entry into application of key provisions of the AI Act. These include delays in designating national competent authorities and conformity assessment bodies, as well as a lack of harmonised standards for the AI Act’s high-risk requirements, guidance, and compliance tools. Such delays risk significantly increasing the compliance costs for businesses and public authorities and slowing down innovation. 

To address these challenges, the Commission is proposing targeted simplification measures 

to ensure timely, smooth, and proportionate implementation of certain of the AI Act’s provisions. These include: 

• linking the implementation timeline of high-risk rules to the availability of standards or other support tools; 

• extending regulatory simplifications granted to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to small mid-caps (SMCs), including simplified technical documentation requirements and special consideration in the application of penalties; 

• requiring the Commission and the Member States to foster AI literacy instead enforcing unspecified obligation on providers and deployers of AI systems in this respect, while training obligations for high-risk deployers remain; 

• offering more flexibility in the post-market monitoring by removing aprescription of a harmonised post-market monitoring plan; 

• reducing the registration burden for providers of AI systems that are used in high-risk areas but for which the provider has concluded that they are not high-risk as they are only used for narrow or procedural tasks; 

• Centralising oversight over a large number of AI systems built on general-purpose AI models or embedded in very large online platforms and very large search engines with the AI Office; 

• facilitating compliance with the data protection laws by allowing providers and deployers of all AI systems and models to process special categories of personal data for ensuring bias detection and correction, with the appropriate safeguards; 

• a broader use of AI regulatory sandboxes and real-world testing , that will benefit European key industries such as the automotive industry, and facilitating an EU-level AI regulatory sandbox which the AI Office will set up as from 2028; 

• targeted changes clarifying the interplay between the AI Act and other EU legislation and adjusting the AI Act’s procedures to improve its overall implementation and operation. 

Beyond the legislative measures, the Commission is taking further measures to facilitate compliance with the AI Act and address the concerns raised by stakeholders. Further guidance is under preparation, focusing on offering clear and practical instructions to apply the AI Act in parallel with other EU legislation. This includes: 

• Guidelines on the practical application of the high-risk classification; 

• Guidelines on the practical application of the transparency requirements under Article 50 AI Act; 

• Guidance on the reporting of serious incidents by providers of high-risk AI systems; 

• Guidelines on the practical application of the high-risk requirements; EN 3 EN 

• Guidelines on the practical application of the obligations for providers and deployers of high-risk AI systems; 

• Guidelines with a template for the fundamental rights impact assessment; 

• Guidelines on the practical application of rules for responsibilities along the AI value chain; 

• Guidelines on the practical application of the provisions related to substantial modification; 

• Guidelines on the post-market monitoring of high-risk AI systems; 

• Gudelines on the elements of the quality management system which SMEs and SMCs may comply with in a simplified manner; 

• Guidelines on the AI Act’s interplay with other Union legislation, for example joint guidelines of the Commission and European Data Protection Board on the interplay of the AI Act and EU data protection law, guidelines on the interplay between the AI Act and the Cyber Resilience Act, and guidelines on the interplay between the AI Act and the Machinery Regulation; 

• Guidelines on the competences and designation procedure for conformity assessment bodies to be designated under the AI Act. 

In particular, stakeholder consultations reveal the need to offer guidance on the practical application of the AI Act’s research exemptions under Article 2(6) and (8), including how they apply in sectoral contexts like in the pre-clinical research and product development in the field of medicinal products or medical devices, which the Commission will work on with priority. 

These simplification efforts will help to ensure that the implementation of the AI Act is smooth, predictable, and innovation-friendly, enabling Europe to strengthen its position as the AI continent and to pursue an AI-first approach safely. 

• Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area 

The proposal is part of a broader Digital Package on Simplification composed of measures to reduce the administrative costs of compliance for businesses and administrations in the EU, which applies to several regulations of the EU’s digital acquis without compromising the objectives of the underlying rules. The proposal builds on Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 and is aligned with existing policies to make the EU a global leader in AI, to make the EU an AI continent and to promote the uptake of human-centric and trustworthy a AI. 

• Consistency with other Union policies 

The proposal is part of a series of simplification packages. 

2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY 

• Legal basis 

The legal basis for this proposal is Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) in line with the original legal basis for the adoption of the legal acts which this proposal aims to amend. EN 4 EN 

• Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) 

Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 was adopted at EU level. Accordingly, amendments to that Regulation need to be made at EU level. 

• Proportionality 

The initiative does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of simplification and burden reduction without lowering the protection of health, safety and fundamental rights. 

• Choice of the instrument 

The proposal amends Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 adopted by ordinary legislative procedure. Therefore, the amendments to that Regulation also must be adopted by regulation in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure. 

3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS 

• Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation 

The proposal is accompanied by a Commission staff working document that provides a detailed overview of the impact of the proposed amendments to certain provisions of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689. It also provides an analysis of the positive impacts of the proposed measures. The analysis is based on existing data, information gathered through consultations and during a reality check and through written stakeholder feedback through a call for evidence. 

• Stakeholder consultations 

Several consultations were carried out in the context of the proposal. They all complemented one another, addressing either different topical issues or stakeholder groups concerned by the initiative. 

In the initial scoping phase of the Digital Package on Simplification, three public consultations and calls for evidence were published on the key strands of the proposal in the spring of 2025. A consultation was held on the Apply AI Strategy from 9 April to 4 June 2025 (5), another on the revision of the Cybersecurity Act from 11 April to 20 June 2025 ( 6), and finally another on the European Data Union Strategy from 23 May to 20 July 2025 ( 7). Each consultation included a questionnaire with a section (or at times multiple) on implementation and simplification concerns, directly related to the reflections on the Digital Package on Simplification. Taken together, 718 responses were received as part of this first consultation exercise.

From 16 September to 14 October 2025, a call for evidence on the Digital Package on Simplification was further published ( 8). Its aim was to cover the whole scope of the initiative and give an opportunity to stakeholders to comment on a more targeted set of proposals in one go. A total of 513 responses were received, by a wide range of stakeholders. 

With a view to raising awareness on the Digital Package on Simplification among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and collecting their feedback, a dedicated SME Panel was organised through the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN) between 4 September and 16 October 2025. The EEN is the world’s largest support network for SMEs and is implemented by the Commission’s European Innovation Council and SMEs Executive Agency (EISMEA). SME Panels are a way to consult stakeholders falling under this framework. SMEs have the opportunity to contribute their views to upcoming policy initiatives. In addition to the online written consultation (where 106 SMEs’ responses were received), the Commission also presented the Digital Package on Simplification to SME associations part of the EEN, in a meeting that took place on 1 October 2025. 

A large number of bilateral meetings were organised by the Commission services with stakeholders in 2025, to address specific concerns. Discussions were also held with Member States. In addition to bilateral exchanges, specific agenda points on the Digital Simplification Package were discussed at Council Working Parties in June and September 2025, where the Commission presented the current situation and asked Member States’ to express their views. 

Overall, stakeholder feedback converged on the need for a simplified application of some of the digital rules. Better coherence, and a focus on optimisation of compliance costs, was largely supported by a cross-section of stakeholders. Some differences in opinion were expressed regarding some of the more tailored measures. A more detailed overview of these stakeholder consultations, and how they were reflected in the proposal can be found in the staff working document accompanying the Digital Package on Simplification. 

• Collection and use of expertise 

In addition to the consultation outlined above, the Commission mainly relied on its own internal analysis for the purpose of this proposal. 

• Impact assessment 

The amendments put forward in the proposal are technical in nature. They are designed to ensure a more efficient implementation of rules that were already agreed at political level. There are no policy options that could meaningfully be tested and compared in an impact assessment report. 

The accompanying staff working document examines the reasoning behind the amendments and outlines the views of stakeholders on the different measures. It also presents the costs savings and other types of impacts the proposal may entail. In many cases, it builds on the impact assessments that was originally carried out for the Regulation (EU) 2024/1689.

# EN 6 EN 

The staff working document therefore serves as a reference point to inform the European Parliament and the Council’s debate on the proposal, as well as the public, in a clear and engaged way. 

• Regulatory fitness and simplification 

The proposal aims to produce a significant reduction in administrative burden for businesses, national administrations, and the public at large. Initial estimates project possible savings of ≈

EUR 297.2 to 433.2 million . Non-quantifiable benefits are also expected, notably due to a streamlined set of rules which will ease compliance and enforcement thereof. 

SMEs already benefit from regulatory privileges under Regulation (EU) 2024/1689. Some regulatory privileges already afforded to SMEs are extended to small mid-caps (SMCs). Since SMEs and SMCs are disproportionality more impacted by the compliance burden, it is expected that they will particularly benefit from these simplification measures. 

The proposal is consistent with the Commission’s ‘Digital Fitness Check for the digital rulebook’, which aims to ensure properly aligned policy proposals with real-world digital environments (see Chapter 4 on Legislative and Financial Digital Statement). 

• Fundamental rights 

Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 is expected to promote the protection of a number of fundamental rights and freedoms set out in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights ( 9), as well as positively impacting the rights of a number of special groups ( 10 ). At the same time, the Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 imposes some restrictions on certain rights and freedoms (11 ), which are proportionate and limited to the minimum necessary. The proposal is not expected to modify the impact of the Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 on fundamental rights since the targeted nature of envisaged amendments do not affect the scope of the regulated AI systems or on the substantive requirements applicable to those systems. 

4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS 

The proposal amends the supervision and enforcement system of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689, whereby oversight over certain AI systems will be transferred to the Commission’s AI Office. In addition, to facilitate compliance by operators, the AI Office should set up an EU-level AI regulatory sandbox. To implement these new tasks, to the Commission will need the appropriate resources, which is estimated to stand at 53 FTE, of which 15 FTE can be covered

by internal redeployment. These implications have to be considered against the backdrop of reduced budgetary implications for the Member States which no longer have to ensure the oversight for those certain AI systems. A detailed overview of the costs involved in this transfer of competences is provided in the ‘Legislative and Financial Digital Statement’ accompanying this proposal. 

5. OTHER ELEMENTS 

• Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements 

The Commission will monitor the implementation, application, and compliance with the new provisions. Furthermore, the Regulation that is amended by this proposal is regularly evaluated for its efficiency, effectiveness in reaching its objectives, relevance, coherence and value added in line with the EU’s better regulation principles. This proposal does not require an implementation plan. 

• Explanatory documents (for directives) 

Not applicable. 

• Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal 

Article 1 amends Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 (‘AI Act’).  In particular, 

• Paragraph 1 adds a reference to SMCs in the subject matter of the AI Act. 

• Paragraph 2 is a technical change that is necessary to enable extending the real-world testing to high-risk AI systems embedded in products covered under Section B of Annex I AI Act. 

• Paragraph 3 adds legal definitions for SME and SMC to the definitions in Article 3 of the AI Act. 

• Paragraph 4 transforms the obligation for providers and deployers of AI systems with regards to AI literacy in Article 4 AI Act to an obligation on the Commission and the Member States to foster AI literacy. 

• Paragraph 5 introduces a new Article 4a, replacing Article 10(5) AI Act, which provides a legal basis for providers and deployers of AI systems and AI models to exceptionally process special categories of personal data for the purpose of ensuring bias detection and correction under certain conditions. 

• Paragraphs 6, 14 and 32 refer to the deletion of the obligation for providers to register AI systems in the EU database for high-risk systems under Annex III, where they have been exempted from classification as high-risk under Article 6(3) AI Act, because they are for instance only used for preparatory tasks. 

• Paragraph 7 contains editorial follow-up changes to amendments made by paragraph 4. 

• Paragraphs 8 and 9 extend existing regulatory privileges of the AI Act for SMEs to SMCs on technical documentation and putting in place a quality management system that takes into account their size. 

• Paragraph 10 introduces a new procedure in Article 28 AI Act, whereby Member States are required to ensure that a conformity assessment body that applies for designation both under this Regulation and Union harmonization legislation listed in EN 8 EN 

Section A of Annex I AI Act shall be provided with the possibility to submit a single application and undergo a single assessment procedure to be designated. 

• Paragraph 11 proposes to replace paragraph 4 of Article 29 AI Act which requires conformity assessment bodies to submit a single application in the cases to which reference is made in that paragraph. 

• Paragraph 12 amends Article 30 AI Act by requiring conformity assessment bodies which apply to be designated as notified bodies to make that application in accordance with the codes, categories, and corresponding types of AI systems referred to in a new Annex XIV for the Commission’s New Approach Notified and Designated Organisations (‘NANDO’) information system, and empowers the Commission to amend these codes, categories, and corresponding types in light of technological developments. 

• Paragraph 13 clarifies the conformity assessment procedure laid down in Article 43 AI Act where a high-risk AI system is covered by Union harmonisation legislation listed under Section A of Annex I to the AI Act and where an AI system is classified as high-risk both under Annex I and Annex III to the AI Act. 

• Paragraphs 15 and 16 remove the Commission empowerments in Articles 50 and 56 AI Act to adopt implementing acts to give codes of practice for general purpose AI models and transparency obligations for certain AI systems general validity in the Union. 

• Paragraph 17 introduces amendments to the rules on AI regulatory sandboxes in Article 57 AI Act, inter alia, by providing the legal basis for the AI Office to introduce an AI regulatory sandbox on EU level for certain AI systems within its exclusive competence of supervision and require Member States to strengthen cross-border cooperation of their sandboxes. 

• Paragraph 18 specifies the empowerment of the Commission to adopt implementing acts specifying the detailed arrangements for the establishment, development, implementation, operation, governance and supervision of AI regulatory sandboxes. 

• Paragraph 19 introduces changes to the testing of high-risk AI systems in real world conditions outside AI regulatory sandboxes as governed by Article 60 AI Act, inter alia extending this opportunity to high-risk AI systems covered by Section A of Annex I. 

• Paragraph 20 creates an additional legal basis for interested Member States and the Commission, on voluntary basis, to enter into written agreements to test high-risk AI systems referred to in Section B of Annex I in real world-conditions. 

• Paragraph 21 extends the derogation from micro-enterprises to SMEs to comply with certain elements of the quality management system required by Article 17 AI Act in 

a simplified manner .

• Paragraph 22 removes an empowerment of the Commission in Article 69 AI Act to adopt an implementing act in relation to the reimbursement of experts of the scientific panel when called upon by Member States, to simplify the procedure. 

• Paragraph 23 extends the focus of guidance which national authorities may provide from SMEs to SMCs. 

• Paragraph 24 replaces the empowerment of the Commission in Article 72 AI Act to adopt an implementing act with regard to the post-market monitoring plan. EN 9 EN 

• Paragraph 25 makes amendments to the supervision and enforcement of certain AI systems in Article 75 AI Act: 

• Point (a) changes the heading. 

• Point (b) reinforces the competence of the AI Office for the supervision and enforcement of certain AI systems, that are based on a general-purpose AI model, where the model and the system are provided by the same provider. At the same time, the provision clarifies that AI systems related to products covered under Annex I are not included in that supervision. Moreover, it is clarified that the supervision and enforcement of the compliance of AI systems embedded in designated very large online platforms or very large online search engines should fall under the competence of the AI Office. 

• Point (c) introduces several new paragraphs, empowering the Commission to adopt implementing acts to define the enforcement powers and the procedures for the exercise of those powers of the AI Office, introducing a reference to Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 ensuring certain procedural safeguards apply to providers covered and empowering the Commission to carry out conformity assessments of AI systems within the scope of Article 75. 

• Paragraph 26 amends Article 77 AI Act as regards the powers of authorities or bodies protecting fundamental rights and cooperation with market surveillance authorities. 

• Paragraphs 27 and 28 extends provisions in Articles 95 and 96 that require that voluntary support tools should take into account the needs of SMEs to SMCs. 

• Paragraph 29 extends existing regulatory privileges in Article 99 AI Act on penalties for SMEs to SMCs. 

• Paragraph 30 contains amendments to Article 111 AI Act which result from amendments made in paragraph 30 and introduces a transitional period of 6 months for providers who need to retroactively include technical solutions in their generative AI systems, to make them machine readable and detectable as artificially generated or manipulated. 

• Paragraph 31 introduces changes to the entry into application of certain provisions of the AI Act: 

• For the obligations for high-risk AI systems in Chapter III, a mechanism is introduced that links the entry into application to the availability of measures in support of compliance with the AI Act’s high-risk rules, such as harmonised standards, common specifications, and Commission guidelines. This availability will be confirmed by the Commission by decision, following which the rules for high-risk AI systems start to apply after an appropriate transition period. However, this flexibility should apply only for a limited time and a definite date by which the rules apply in any case should be set. Moreover, it is appropriate to distinguish between the two types of AI systems that classify as high-risk and extend a longer transition period to AI systems that classify as high-risk pursuant to Article 6(1) and Annex I to the AI Act. 

• It is clarified that the amendments necessary to integrate the high-risk requirements into sectoral law listed in Section B of Annex I apply with the Digital Omnibus’ entry into force. EN 10 EN 

• Paragraph 33 is related to the change in paragraph 11 and introduces a new Annex XIV setting out codes, categories, and corresponding types of AI systems referred to in a new Annex XIV for the Commission’s New Approach Notified and Designated Organisations (‘NANDO’) information system. 

Article 2 makes amendments with regards to Regulation (EU) 2018/1139, to allow a smooth integration of the AI Act’s high-risk requirements into that Regulation. 

Article 3 provides the rule of entry into force and the binding nature of this Regulation. EN 11 EN

amending Regulations (EU) 2024/1689 and (EU) 2018/1139 as regards the simplification of the implementation of harmonised rules on artificial intelligence (Digital Omnibus on AI) 

(Text with EEA relevance) 

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof, 

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, 

After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments, 

Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 1,

Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 2,

Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, 

Whereas: 

(1) Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 of the European Parliament and of the Council 3 lays down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence (AI) and aims to improve the functioning of the internal market, to promote the uptake of human-centric and trustworthy artificial intelligence, while ensuring a high level of protection of health, safety and fundamental rights, and supporting innovation. Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 entered into force on 1 August 2024. Its provisions enter into application in a staggered manner, with all rules entering into application by 2 August 2027. 

(2) The experience gathered in implementing the parts of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 that have already entered into application can inform the implementation of those parts that are yet to apply. In this context, the delayed preparation of standards, which should provide technical solutions for providers of high-risk AI systems to ensure compliance with their obligations under that regulation, and the delayed establishment of

the governance and the conformity assessment frameworks at national level result in a compliance burden that is heavier than expected. In addition, consultations of stakeholders have revealed the need for additional measures that facilitate and provide clarification on the implementation and compliance, without reducing the level of protection for health, safety and fundamental rights from AI-related risks that the rules of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 seek to achieve. 

(3) Consequently, targeted amendments to Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 are necessary to address certain implementation challenges, with a view to the effective application of the relevant rules. 

(4) Enterprises outgrowing the micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (‘SME’) definition – the ‘small mid-cap enterprises’ (‘SMCs’) – play a vital role in the Union’s economy. Compared to SMEs, SMCs tend to demonstrate a higher pace of growth, and level of innovation and digitisation. Nevertheless, they face challenges similar to SMEs in relation to administrative burden, leading to a need for proportionality in the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 and for targeted support. To enable the smooth transition of enterprises from SMEs into SMCs, it is important to address in a coherent manner the effect that regulation may have on their activity once those enterprises outgrow the segment of SMEs and are faced with rules that apply to large enterprises. Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 provides for several measures for small-scale providers, which should be extended to SMCs. In order to clarify the treatment of SMEs and SMCs in Regulation (EU) 2024/1689, it is necessary to introduce definitions for SMEs and SMCs, which should correspond to the definition set out in the Annex to Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC 4 and Annex to Commission Recommendation 2025/3500/EC 5.

(5) Article 4 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 currently imposes an obligation on all providers and deployers of AI systems to ensure AI literacy of their staff. AI literacy development starting from education and training and continuing in a lifelong learning manner is crucial to equip providers, deployers and other affected persons with the necessary notions to make informed decisions regarding AI systems deployment. However, experience shared by stakeholders reveals that a one-size-fits-all solution is not suitable for all types of providers and deployers in relation to the promotion of AI literacy, rendering such a horizontal obligation ineffective in achieving the objective pursued by this provision. Moreover, data indicate that imposing such an obligation creates an additional compliance burden, particularly for smaller enterprises, whereas AI literacy should be a strategic priority, regardless of regulatory obligations and potential sanctions. In light of that, Article 4 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 should be amended to require the Member States and the Commission, without prejudice to their respective competences, to individually, collectively and in cooperation with relevant stakeholders encourage providers and deployers to provide a sufficient level of AI literacy of their staff and other persons dealing with the operation and use of AI

systems on their behalf, including through offering training opportunities, providing informational resources, and allowing exchange of good practices and other non-legally binding initiatives. The European Artificial Intelligence Board (‘Board’) will ensure recurrent exchange between the Commission and Member States on the topic, while the Apply AI Alliance will allow discussion with the wider community. This amendment is without prejudice to the broader measures taken by the Commission and the Member States to promote AI literacy and competences for the wider population, including learners, students, and citizens at different ages and in particular through education and training systems. 

(6) Bias detection and correction constitute a substantial public interest because they protect natural persons from biases’ adverse effects, including discrimination. Discrimination might result from the bias in AI models and AI systems other than high-risk AI systems for which of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 already provides a legal basis authorising the processing of special categories of personal data under Article 9(2), point (g), of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council 6. Given that discrimination might result also from those other AI systems and models, it is therefore appropriate that Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 should provide for a legal basis for the processing of special categories of personal data also by providers and deployers of other AI systems and AI models as well as deployers of high-risk AI systems. The legal basis is established in compliance with Article 9(2), point (g) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 Article 10(2), point (g) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council 7 and Article 10, point (a) of Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council 8 provides a legal basis allowing, where necessary for the detection and removal of bias, the processing of special categories of personal data by providers and deployers of all AI systems and models, subject to appropriate safeguards that complement Regulations (EU) 2016/679, Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and Directive (EU) 2016/680, as applicable. 

(7) In order to ensure consistency, avoid duplication and minimise administrative burdens in relation to the procedure for designating notified bodies under Regulation (EU) 2024/1689, while maintaining the same level of scrutiny, a single application and a single assessment procedure should be available for new conformity assessment

bodies and notified bodies which are designated under the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Section A of Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2024/1689, such as under Regulations (EU) 2017/745 9 and (EU) 2017/746 10  of the European Parliament and of the Council, where such a procedure is established under that Union harmonisation legislation. The single application and assessment procedure aims at facilitating, supporting and expediting the designation procedure under Regulation (EU) 2024/1689, while ensuring compliance with the requirements applicable to notified bodies under that Regulation and the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Section A of Annex I thereto. 

(8) With a view to ensuring the smooth application and consistency of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689, amendments should be made to it. A technical correction to Article 43(3), first subparagraph, of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 should be added to align the conformity assessment requirements with the requirements of providers of high-risk AI systems in Article 16 of that Regulation. Moreover, it should be clarified that where a provider of a high-risk AI system is subject to the conformity assessment procedure under Union harmonisation legislation listed in Section A of Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2024/1689, and the conformity assessment extends to compliance of the quality management system of that Regulation and of such Union harmonisation legislation, the provider should be able to include aspects related to quality management systems under that Regulation as part of the quality management systems under such Union harmonisation legislation, in line with Article 17(3) of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689. Article 43(3), second subparagraph, should be amended to clarify that notified bodies which have been notified under the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Section A of Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 and which aim to assess high-risk AI systems covered by the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Section A of Annex I to that Regulation, should apply for the designation as a notified body under that Regulation within 18 months from [the entry into application of this Regulation]. This amendment is without prejudice to Article 28 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689. Moreover, Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 should be amended to clarify that where a high-risk AI system is both covered by the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Section A of Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 and falls within one of the use-cases listed in Annex III to that Regulation, the provider should follow the relevant conformity assessment procedure as required under that relevant harmonisation legislation. 

(9) To streamline compliance and reduce the associated costs, providers of AI systems should not be required to register AI systems referred to in Article 6(3) of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 in the EU database pursuant to Article 49(2) of that Regulation. Given that such systems are not considered high-risk under certain conditions where

they do not pose significant risk of harm to the health, safety or fundamental rights of persons, imposing registration requirements would constitute a disproportionate compliance burden. Nevertheless, a provider who considers that an AI system falls under Article 6(3) remains obligated to document its assessment before that system is placed on the market or put into service. This assessment may be requested by national competent authorities. 

(10) Articles 57, 58 and 60 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 should be amended to strengthen further cooperation at Union level of AI regulatory sandboxes, foster clarity and consistency in the governance of AI regulatory sandboxes, and to extend the scope of real-world testing outside AI regulatory sandboxes to high-risk AI systems covered by the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex I to that Regulation. In particular, to allow procedural simplification, where applicable, in the projects supervised in the AI regulatory sandboxes that include also real-world testing, the real-world testing plan should be integrated in the sandbox plan agreed by the providers or prospective providers and the competent authority in a single document. In addition, it is appropriate to provide for the possibility of the AI Office to establish an AI regulatory sandbox at Union level for AI systems that are covered by Article 75(1) of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689. By leveraging these infrastructures and facilitating cross-border collaboration, coordination would be better streamlined and resources optimally utilised. 

(11) To foster innovation, it is also appropriate to extend the scope of real-world testing outside AI regulatory sandboxes in Article 60 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689, currently applicable to high-risk AI systems listed in Annex III to that Regulation, and allow providers and prospective providers of high-risk AI systems covered by the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex I to that Regulation to also test such systems in real-world conditions. This is without prejudice to other Union or national law on the testing in real-world conditions of high-risk AI systems related to products covered by that Union harmonisation legislation. To address the specific situation of high-risk AI systems covered the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Section B of Annex I to that Regulation, it is necessary to allow the conclusion of voluntary agreements between the Commission and Member States to enable testing of such high-risk AI systems in real-world conditions. 

(12) Article 63 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 offers microenterprises who are providers of high-risk AI systems the possibility to benefit from a simplified way to comply with the obligation to establish a quality management system. With a view to facilitating compliance for more innovators, that possibility should be extended to all SMEs, including start-ups. 

(13) Article 69 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 should be amended to simplify the fee structure of the scientific panel. If Member States call upon the panel’s expertise, the fees they may be required to pay the experts should be equivalent to the remuneration the Commission is obliged to pay in similar circumstances. Furthermore, to reduce the procedural complexity, Member States should be able to consult the experts of the scientific panel directly, without involvement of the Commission. 

(14) In order to strengthen the governance system for AI systems based on general-purpose AI models, it is necessary to clarify the role of the AI Office in monitoring and supervising compliance of such AI systems with Regulation (EU) 2024/1689, while excluding AI systems related to products covered by the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex I to that Regulation. While sectoral authorities continue to EN 16 EN 

remain responsible for the supervision of AI systems related to products covered by that Union harmonisation legislation, Article 75(1) Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 should be modified to bring all AI systems based on general-purpose AI models developed by the same provider within the scope of the AI Office's supervision. This does not include AI systems placed on the market, put into service or used by Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, which are under the supervision of the European Data Protection Supervisor pursuant to Article 74(9) of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689. To ensure effective supervision for those AI systems in accordance with the tasks and responsibilities assigned to market surveillance authorities under Regulation (EU) 2024/1689, the AI Office should be empowered to take the appropriate measures and decisions to adequately exercise its powers provided for in that Section and Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council 11 . Article 14 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 should apply mutatis mutandis. Furthermore, to ensure effective enforcement, the authorities involved in the application of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 should cooperate actively in the exercise of those powers, in particular where enforcement actions need to be taken in the territory of a Member State. 

(15) Considering the existing supervisory and enforcement system under Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 of the European Parliament and of the Council 12 , it is appropriate to grant the Commission the powers of a competent market surveillance authority under Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 where an AI system qualifies as a very large online platform or a very large online search engine within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065, or where it is embedded in such a platform or search engine. This should contribute to ensuring that the exercise of the Commission’s supervision and enforcement powers under Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 and Regulation (EU) 2022/2065, as well as those applicable to general-purpose AI models integrated into such platforms or search engines, are carried out in a coherent manner. In the case of AI systems embedded in or qualifying as a very large online platform or search engine, the first point of entry for the assessment of the AI systems are the risk assessment, mitigating measures and audit obligations prescribed by Articles 34, 35 and 37 of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065, without prejudice to the AI Office’s powers to investigate and enforce ex post non-compliance with the rules of this Regulation. In the context of the analysis of this risk assessment, mitigating measures and audits, the Commission services responsible for the enforcement of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 may seek the opinion of the AI Office on the outcome of a potential earlier or parallel risk assessment carried out under this Regulation and the applicability of prohibitions under this Regulation. In addition, the AI Office and the competent national authorities under (EU) 2024/1689 should coordinate their enforcement efforts with the authorities

competent for the supervision and enforcement of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065, including the Commission, in order to ensure that the principles of loyal cooperation, proportionality and non bis in idem are respected, while information obtained under the respective other Regulation would be used for the purposes of supervision and enforcement of the other only provided the undertaking agrees. In particular, those authorities should exchange views regularly and take into account, in their respective areas of competence, any fines and penalties imposed on the same provider for the same conduct through a final decision in proceedings relating to an infringement of other Union or national rules, so as to ensure that the overall fines and penalties imposed are proportionate and correspond to the seriousness of the infringements committed. 

(16) To further operationalise the AI Office’s supervision and enforcement set out in Article 75(1) of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689, it is necessary to further define the which of the powers listed in Article 14 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 should be conferred upon the AI Office. The Commission should therefore be empowered to adopt implementing acts to specify those powers, including the ability to impose penalties, such as fines or other administrative sanctions, in accordance with the conditions and ceilings referred to in Article 99, and applicable procedures. This should ensure that the AI Office has the necessary tools to effectively monitor and supervise compliance with Regulation (EU) 2024/1689. 

(17) Additionally, it is essential to ensure that effective procedural safeguards apply to providers of AI systems subject to monitoring and supervision by the AI Office. To that end, the procedural rights provided for in Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 should apply mutatis mutandis to providers of AI systems, without prejudice to more specific procedural rights provided for in Regulation (EU) 2024/1689. 

(18) To enable access to Union market for AI systems which are under the supervision by the AI Office pursuant to Article 75 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 and subject to third party conformity assessment, the Commission should be enabled to carry out pre-market conformity assessments of those systems. 

(19) Article 77 and related provisions of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 constitute an important governance mechanism, as they aim to enable authorities or bodies responsible for enforcing or supervising Union law intended to protect fundamental rights to fulfil their mandate under specific conditions and to foster cooperation with market surveillance authorities responsible for the supervision and enforcement of that Regulation. It is necessary to clarify the scope of such cooperation, as well as to clarify which public authorities or bodies benefit from it. With a view to reinforcing the cooperation, it should be clarified that requests to access information and documentation should be made to the competent market surveillance authority, which should respond to such requests, and that the involved authorities or bodies should have a mutual obligation to cooperate. 

(20) To allow sufficient time for providers of generative AI systems subject to the marking obligations laid down in Article 50(2) of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 to adapt their practices within a reasonable time without disrupting the market, it is appropriate to introduce a transitional period of 6 months for providers who have already placed their systems on the market before the 2 August 2026. 

(21) To provide sufficient time for providers of high-risk AI systems and to clarify applicable rules to the AI systems already placed on the market or put into service EN 18 EN 

before the entry into application of relevant provisions of the Regulation (EU) 2024/1689, it is appropriate to clarify the application of a grace period provided in Article 111(2) of that Regulation. The grace period, for the purpose of Article 111(2), should apply to a type and model of AI systems already placed in the market. This means that if at least one individual unit of the high-risk AI system has been lawfully placed on the market or put into service before the date specified in Article 111(2), other individual units of the same type and model of high-risk AI system are subject to the grace period provided in Article 111(2) and thus may continue to be placed on the market, made available or put into service on the Union market without any additional obligations, requirements or the need for additional certification, as long as the design of that high-risk AI system remains unchanged. For the purposes of application of the grace period provided in Article 111(2), the decisive factor is the date on which the first unit of that type and model of high-risk AI system was placed on the market or put into service on the Union market for the first time. Any significant change to the design of that AI system after the date specified in Article 111(2) should trigger the obligation of the provider to comply fully with all relevant provisions of this Regulation applicable to high-risk AI systems, including the conformity assessment requirements. 

(22) Article 113 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 establishes the dates of entry into force and application of that Regulation, notably that the general date of application is 2 August 2026. For the obligations related to high-risk AI systems laid down in Sections 1, 2 and 3 of Chapter III of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689, the delayed availability of standards, common specifications, and alternative guidance and the delayed establishment of national competent authorities lead to challenges that jeopardise those obligation’s effective entry into application and that risk to significantly increase implementation costs in a way that does not justify maintaining their initial date of application, namely 2 August 2026. Building on experience, it is appropriate to put in place a mechanism that links the entry into application to the availability of measures in support of compliance with Chapter III, which may include harmonised standards, common specifications, and Commission guidelines. This should be confirmed by the Commission by decision, following which the rules obligations for high-risk AI systems should apply after 6 months as regards AI systems classified as high-risk pursuant to Article 6(2) and Annex III and after 12 months as regards AI systems classified as high-risk pursuant to Article 6(1) and Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2024/1689. However, this flexibility should only be extended until 2 December 2027 as regards AI systems classified as high-risk pursuant to Article 6(2) and Annex III and until 2 August 2028 as regards AI systems classified as high-risk pursuant to Article 6(1) and Annex I to that Regulation, by which dates those rules should enter into application in any case. The distinction between the entry into application of the rules as regards AI systems classified as high-risk pursuant to Article 6(2) and Annex III and Article 6(1) and Annex I to that Regulation is consistent with the difference between the initial dates of application envisaged in Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 and aims to provide the necessary time for adaptation and implementation of the corresponding obligations. 

(23) In light of the objective to reduce implementation challenges for citizens, businesses and public administrations, it is essential that harmonised conditions for the implementation of certain rules are adopted only where strictly necessary. For that purpose, it is appropriate to remove certain empowerments bestowed on the Commission to adopt such harmonised conditions by means of implementing acts in cases where those conditions are not met. Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 should therefore EN 19 EN 

be amended to remove the empowerments conferred on the Commission in Article 50(7), Article 56(6), and Article 72(3) thereof to adopt implementing acts. The removal of the empowerment to adopt a harmonised template for a post-market monitoring plan in Article 72(3) of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 has as an additional benefit that it will offer more flexibility for providers of high-risk AI systems to put in place a system for post-market monitoring that is tailored to their organisation. At the same time, recognising the need to offer clarity how providers of high-risk AI systems are required to comply, the Commission should be required to publish guidance. 

(24) Conformity assessment of high-risk AI systems under Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 may require involvement of conformity assessment bodies. Only conformity assessment bodies that have been designated under that Regulation may carry out conformity assessments and only for the activities related to the categories and types of AI systems concerned. To enable the specification of the scope of the designation of conformity assessment bodies notified under Article 30 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689, it is necessary to draw up a list of codes, categories, and corresponding types of AI systems. The list of codes should take into account whether the AI system is a component of a product or itself a product covered by the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex I (referred to as ‘AIP codes’, for AI systems covered by product legislation) or a system referred in Annex III of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689, which currently concerns only biometric AI systems referred to in point (1) of Annex III (referred to as ‘AIB codes’, for biometric AI systems). Both AIP codes and AIB codes are vertical codes. The AIP codes are reference codes to provide a link to the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Section A of Annex I of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689. The AIB codes are new codes specific to Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 to identify biometric AI systems referred in paragraph 1 of Annex III of that Regulation. The list of codes should also take into account specific types and underlying technologies of AI systems (referred to as ‘AIH codes’, for horizontal AI system codes). The AIH codes are new AI technology-specific codes and can be applied in conjunction with AIP or AIB vertical codes. The AIH codes cover AI systems’ underlying types and technologies. The list of codes, including three categories, should provide for a multi-dimensional typology of AI systems which ensures that conformity assessment bodies designated as notified bodies are fully competent for the AI systems they are required to assess. 

(25) Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 of the European Parliament and the Council 13  lays down common rules in the field of civil aviation. Article 108 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 sets out amendments to Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 to ensure that the Commission takes into account, on the basis of the technical and regulatory specificities of the civil aviation sector, and without interfering with existing governance, conformity

Processing of special categories of personal data for bias detection and mitigation 

1. To the extent necessary to ensure bias detection and correction in relation to high-risk AI systems in accordance with Article 10 (2), points (f) and (g), of this Regulation, providers of such systems may exceptionally process special categories of personal data, subject to appropriate safeguards for the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons. In addition to the safeguards set out in Regulations (EU) 2016/679 and (EU) 2018/1725 and Directive (EU) 2016/680, as applicable, all the following conditions shall be met in order for such processing to occur: 

(a) the bias detection and correction cannot be effectively fulfilled by processing other data, including synthetic or anonymised data; 

(b) the special categories of personal data are subject to technical limitations on the re-use of the personal data, and state-of-the-art security and privacy-preserving measures, including pseudonymisation; 

(c) the special categories of personal data are subject to measures to ensure that the personal data processed are secured, protected, subject to suitable safeguards, including strict controls and documentation of the access, to avoid misuse and ensure that only authorised persons have access to those personal data with appropriate confidentiality obligations; 

(d) the special categories of personal data are not transmitted, transferred or otherwise accessed by other parties; 

(e) the special categories of personal data are deleted once the bias has been corrected or the personal data has reached the end of its retention period, whichever comes first; 

(f) the records of processing activities pursuant to Regulations (EU) 2016/679 and (EU) 2018/1725 and Directive (EU) 2016/680 include the reasons why the processing of special categories of personal data was necessary to detect and correct biases, and why that objective could not be achieved by processing other data. 

2. Paragraph 1 may apply to providers and deployers of other AI systems and models and deployers of high-risk AI systems where necessary and proportionate if the processing occurs for the purposes set out therein and provided that the conditions set out under the safeguards set out in this paragraph.;

1. FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE 

1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative 

Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending 

Regulations (EU) 2024/1689 and (EU) 2018/1139 as regards the simplification of the 

implementation of harmonised rules on artificial intelligence (Digital Omnibus on 

AI) 

1.2. Policy area(s) concerned 

Communications Networks, Content and Technology; 

Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs 

The budgetary impact concerns the new tasks entrusted with the AI Office. 

1.3. Objective(s) 

1.3.1. General objective(s) 

1. To strengthen the monitoring and supervision of certain categories of AI systems 

by the AI Office. 

2. To facilitate the development and testing at EU level of innovative AI systems 

under strict regulatory oversight before these systems are placed on the market or 

otherwise put into service. 

1.3.2. Specific objective(s) 

Specific objective No 1 

To enhance governance and effective enforcement of the AI Act rules related to AI 

systems by reinforcing the powers and procedures applicable as well as by providing 

for new resources for the AI Office in charge of the enforcement. 

Specific objective No 2 

To provide for the establishment of a sandbox at EU level, enabling cross border 

activities and testing. 

1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact 

> Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.

AI providers should benefit from a centralised level of governance and the access to 

an EU-level sandbox for certain categories of AI systems, avoiding duplication of 

procedures and costs. 

1.3.4. Indicators of performance 

> Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.

Indicator 1 

Number of AI systems falling under the scope of the monitoring and supervision 

tasks to be carried out by the AI Office. 

Indicator 2 

Number of providers and prospective providers requesting access to the sandbox at 

EU level. EN 4 EN 

1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:  

> 

a new action  

> 

a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 26  

> 

the extension of an existing action  

> 

a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action 

1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative 

1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative 

The additional elements relevant for the enhancement of the governance structure of 

the AI Office should be in place before the entry into application of the provisions 

applicable to AI systems. 

The first EU sandbox is expected to be operational in 2028, although some key 

setting details should be established beforehand. 

1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone. 

The AI Office will have the power to monitor and supervise the compliance of all AI 

systems based on general-purpose AI (GPAI) models, where the model and the 

system are developed by the same provider, as well as all AI systems embedded in or 

constituting very large online platforms or search engines, even if the system and 

GPAI model provider are different. The tasks that the AI Office would need to carry 

out for this vast range of AI systems include requesting full access to documentation, 

training/validation/testing datasets, and, when necessary, the source code of high-risk 

AI systems, supervising real-world testing, identifying and evaluating risks, dealing 

with serious incidents, taking preventive and corrective measures while ensuring 

cooperation with national market surveillance authorities, dealing with AI systems 

classified as not high-risk by the provider, dealing with complaints of non-

compliance, and imposing penalties. Moreover, to allow market access for AI 

systems in the scope of this provision which are also subject to pre-market third-

party conformity assessment under the AI Act, the AI Office will be the responsible 

body to carry out conformity assessments. All these actions require resources and a 

set of enforcement procedures to be developed and implemented, as well as the 

appropriate technical support to assess and evaluate systems. 

The AI Office’s role in ensuring compliance would also involve ensuring synergies 

with the evaluation of the GPAI models, which would strengthen the overall 

evaluations of models and systems provided by the same provider. This would enable 

a more comprehensive understanding of the AI systems and their associated risks,  

> 26 As referred to in Article 58(2), point (a) or (b) of the Financial Regulation.

# EN 5 EN 

allowing for more effective monitoring and enforcement. The AI Office will also 

need to consider the unique challenges posed by agentic AI, which can operate 

autonomously and make decisions that may have significant consequences, and 

develop strategies to address these risks in line with Commission policies. 

The enhancement of the AI Office’s governance would bring numerous benefits to 

the regulation of AI systems in the EU. One of the primary advantages is the 

consistency and coherence it would ensure in the application of the AI Act across the 

EU. By having a single authority overseeing the implementation of the AI Act in 

relation to certain categories of AI systems, the risk of conflicting interpretations and 

decisions would be significantly reduced, providing clarity and certainty for 

companies operating in the EU. 

Furthermore, this would simplify the regulatory landscape for companies, as they 

would only need to deal with one regulator, rather than multiple national authorities. 

This would reduce the complexity and administrative burden associated with 

navigating different regulatory frameworks, allowing companies to focus on 

innovation and growth. The centralised approach would also enable the development 

within the Commission of specialised expertise in AI systems and GPAI models, 

enabling more effective monitoring and enforcement of the AI Act. 

This approach would avoid diverging national enforcement actions on the AI systems 

concerned that may lead to the fragmentation of the internal market and decrease 

legal certainty for operators. This would also address the challenges faced by 

Member States in securing specialised resources to staff their authorities responsible 

for implementing the AI Act and overseeing AI systems within their territories. By 

centralizing market surveillance authorities’ powers within the AI Office, this 

scenario would enable the AI Office to assume responsibility for evaluating and 

monitoring complex AI systems provided by the same model provider, as well as AI 

systems constituting or embedded into platforms, thereby alleviating the burden on 

national authorities. This would leverage the AI Office's existing expertise in 

evaluating GPAI models and monitoring their compliance, creating a unique 

concentration of specialized knowledge and capabilities. As a result, the AI Office 

would be well-positioned to provide consistent and effective oversight, while also 

supporting Member States in their efforts to implement the AI Act and ensure a 

harmonized regulatory environment across the EU. With the AI Office handling 

these additional tasks, national authorities could focus more on their enforcement 

actions under the AI Act, allowing for a more efficient allocation of resources and a 

more effective implementation of the AI Act across the EU. 

1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past 

The European Commission's experience in enforcing the Digital Services Act (DSA) 

provides valuable lessons that can be applied to the enforcement of the AI Act. In 

particular, the establishment of a robust and transparent enforcement framework, 

which sets out clear procedures for investigating and addressing breaches of the DSA 

and the close cooperation with national authorities, to ensure that enforcement 

actions are coordinated and effective, represent relevant elements in this context. 

The Commission’s experience with DSA enforcement has shown that this approach 

can be effective in promoting compliance and protecting users' rights. For example, 

the Commission has already taken action against several online platforms for 

breaches of the DSA, and has worked with national authorities to develop guidance 

and best practices for compliance. EN 6 EN 

By building on the lessons learned from DSA enforcement, the Commission can 

develop an effective enforcement framework for the AI Act that promotes 

compliance, and supports the development of a trustworthy and innovative AI 

ecosystem in the EU. This will involve enhancing the AI Office enforcement role to 

duly monitor and supervision certain categories of AI systems, and working closely 

with national authorities to ensure that the AI Act is enforced in a consistent and 

effective manner. 

The possibility to provide for an EU-level sandbox should be seen as complementing 

the sandboxes established at national level and should be implemented in a way to 

facilitate cross-border cooperation between national competent authorities. 

1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments 

The amendments proposed to the AI Act within this initiative would result in a 

significant increase in the number of AI systems subject to the monitoring and 

supervision of the AI Office, with a corresponding rise in the number of systems 

potentially eligible to participate in an EU-level sandbox. To effectively manage this 

expansion, it is essential to strengthen the European regulatory and coordination 

function, as proposed in this initiative. This reinforcement would enable the AI 

Office to efficiently oversee the growing number of AI systems, ensure compliance 

with the regulatory framework, and provide a supportive environment for innovation 

and testing through the EU-level sandbox. 

1.5.5. Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for redeployment 

The AI Office will make an effort in order to redeploy part of the staff allocated but 

could do it only partially (15 FTEs) as the staff is currently fully allocated to tasks 

directly linked to ensuring a timely and correct implementation of the AI Act. New 

resources will be needed (estimated in 38 additional FTEs) to efficiently exercise the 

new enforcement tasks. 

In particular, the AI Office plans to identify colleagues with legal and procedural 

expertise who can take on part of the upcoming new enforcement tasks. At this stage, 

we estimate that around 5 CAs with relevant profiles can be redeployed for this 

purpose. 

In addition, the AI Office will make an effort to redeploy 5 officials. 

The AI Office envisages to make fully operational the EU-level sandbox for AI 

systems falling under its monitoring in 2028, which will make possible a

redeployment of 3 CAs needed to set up and run the sandbox. This phased approach 

would enable to ensure the full operational capacity of the sandbox by 2028, and in 

particular will also give the AI Office the time to identify the most suitable staff to 

cover this task and ensure proper project management for facilitating the 

development, training, testing, and validation of innovative AI systems. 

In addition, the AI Office will explore opportunities to expand the scope of IT tools 

(currently mostly in development or pre-launch phase) supporting the AI Act to also 

cover relevant new enforcement activities (i.e. case handling, AI system registry, 

monitoring and reporting, exchange of information with authorities). 2 FTEs with IT 

and administrative profiles will be redeployed to manage these IT tools. This would 

help to partially cover the management needs related to the new tasks. EN 7 EN 

Overall, these redeployment efforts and synergies will help to address some of the 

staffing needs for the new enforcement tasks, while additional resources will be 

necessary to ensure the effective implementation of the AI Act. 

Additional staff will be funded under DEP support, given that the objectives of the 

proposed amendments contribute directly to one key objective of Digital Europe – 

accelerating AI development and deployment in Europe. EN 8 EN

2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES 

2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules 

Specify frequency and conditions. 

The strengthened dispositions will be reviewed and evaluated with the entire AI Act 

in August 2029. The Commission will report on the findings of the evaluation to the 

European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social 

Committee. 

2.2. Management and control system(s) 

2.2.1. Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed 

The regulation reinforces the European policy with regard to harmonised rules for 

the provision of artificial intelligence systems in the internal market while ensuring 

the respect of safety and fundamental rights. The simplified single supervision 

ensures consistency for the cross-border application of the obligations under this 

Regulation. 

In order to face these new tasks, it is necessary to appropriately resource the 

Commission’s services. The enforcement of the new regulation is estimated to 

require 53 FTE. 

2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them 

The risks correspond to the standard risks of Commission operations and are 

adequately covered by existing standard risk minimising procedures. 

2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure) 

For the meeting expenditure, given the low value per transaction (e.g. refunding 

travel costs for a delegate for a meeting), standard control procedures seem 

sufficient. 

2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities 

Specify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures, e.g. from the anti-fraud strategy. 

The existing fraud prevention measures applicable to the Commission will cover the 

additional appropriations necessary for this Regulation. EN 10 EN
