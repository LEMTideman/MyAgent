against Protected Classes. 

1.11.  Features  mean the different attributes of datapoints as recorded in the data. 

1.12.  Hidden Variable  means an attribute of a datapoint or an attribute of a system that 

has a causal relation to other attributes, but is itself not measured or 

unmeasurable. 

1.13.  Human-Centric Design 

& Redress 

means orienting Products and/or Models to focus on humans and their 

environments through promoting human and/or environment centric 

values and allowing for redress. 

1.14.  Implementation  means every aspect of the Product and Model(s) insertion of and/or 

application to Organisation systems, infrastructure, processes and culture 

and Domains and Society. 

1.15.  Incident  means the occurrence of a technical event that affects the integrity of a 

Product and/or Model. 

1.16.  Label  means the Feature that represents the (supposed) ground-truth values 

corresponding to the Target Variable. 

As used in this Best Practice Guideline, the following terms shall have the following meanings where capitalised. 

All references to the singular shall include references to the plural, where applicable, and vice versa. Any terms 

not defined or capitalised in this Best Practice Guideline shall hold their plain text meaning as cited in English and 

data science.

1. Definitions - FBPML Technical Best Practices v1.0.0. 

1.17.  Machine Learning  means the use and development of computer systems and Models that 

are able to learn and adapt with minimal explicit human instructions by 

using algorithms and statistical modelling to analyse, draw inferences, and 

derive outputs from data. 

1.18.  Model  means Machine Learning algorithms and data processing designed, 

developed, trained and implemented to achieve set outputs, inclusive of 

datasets used for said purposes unless otherwise stated. 

1.19.  Organisation  means the concerned juristic entity designing, developing and/or 

implementing Machine Learning. 

1.20.  Outcome  means the resultant effect of applying Models and/or Products. 

1.21.  Output  means that which Models produce, typically (but not exclusively) 

predictions or decisions. 

1.22.  Performance 

Robustness 

means the propensity of Products and/or Models to retain their desired 

performance over diverse and wide operational conditions. 

1.23.  Product  means the collective and broad process of design, development, 

implementation and operationalisation of Models, and associated 

processes, to execute and achieve Product Definition(s), inclusive of, 

amongst other things, the integration of such operations and/or Models 

into organisation products, software and/or systems. 

1.24.  Product Manager  means either a Design Owner and/or Run Owner as identified in the 

Organisation Best Practice Guideline in Sections 3.1.4. & 3.1.7. respectively. 

1.25.  Product Team  means the collective group of Organisation employees directly charged 

with designing, developing and/or implementing the Product. 

1.26.  Product Subjects  means the entities and/or objects that are represented as data points in 

datasets and/or Models, and who may be the subject of Product and/or 

Model outcomes. 

1.27.  Project Lifecycle  means the collective phases of Products from initiation to termination 

- such as design, exploration, experimentation, development, 

implementation, operationalisation, and decommissioning - and their 

mutual iterations. 

1.28.  Protected Classes  mean (Sub)populations of Product Subjects, typically persons, that are 

protected by law, regulation, policy or based on Product Definition(s) 

1.29.  Root Cause Analysis  means the activity and/or report of the investigation into the primary 

causal reasons for the existence of some behaviour (usually an error or 

deviation). 

1.30.  Safety  means real Product Domain based physical harms that result through 

Products and/or Models applications. 

1.31.  Security  means the resilience of Products and/or Models against malicious and/ 

or negligent activities that result in Organisational loss of control over 

concerned Products and/or Models. Notice: This document and its content has been licensed under the  Creative Commons Attribution license  by the  Foundation (Stichting) for Best Practices in Machine Learning  (kvk number:

proportion of all real Subjects that might potentially be recorded in the 

dataset that are actually recorded in a dataset. 

1.33.  Stakeholders  mean the department(s) and/or team(s) within the Organisation who do 

not conduct data science and/or technical Machine Learning, but have a 

material interest in Product Machine Learning. 

1.34.  (Sub)population  means any group of persons, animals, or any other entities represented 

by a piece of data , that is part of a larger (potential) dataset and
