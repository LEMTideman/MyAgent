But I think the winner of the moment of
the fragmentation that's going on are
the tech companies. It's not the people.
And if you're Google and I have great
initiatives like [music] the EU AI act,
I have um other initiatives all over the
[music] world, then I am going to be
affected by them. I'm going to have to
deal with them. [music] I'm going to
have to comply if I want to do business
in Europe. But I'm [music] massive and I
may find a way around some of those
regulations.
>> Welcome to the regulating AI podcast
with Sanjay Puri. AI is changing the
world faster than rules can keep up. So
how do we protect people without [music]
killing progress? Each week, Sanjay
brings you inside conversations with
global leaders, policy makers, and
innovators who [music] are wrestling
with that exact question. So, if you're
curious about the future of technology
and how it's governed, you're in the
right place.
Joining us today on the Regulating AI
[music] podcast is Dr. Mark Robinson,
senior science diplomacy adviser at the
Oxford Martin EI governance initiative.
With decades of experience shaping
global science collaborations, [music]
he now brings that diplomatic lens to
the frontier of EI governance.
Mark, welcome to the regulating AI
podcast.
>> Thank you, Sanji. Very pleased to be
here and joining you today.
>> Wonderful. You have spent decades uh
Mark, managing massive international
science projects like ITAR, ESO, and
you're taking some of those lessons that
you have learned and applying it to
artificial intelligence governance. Tell
our audience what are some of the
parallels that you see between governing
let's say fusion energy and governing AI
and what differences should policy
makers understand. The way to look at
the big facility science projects is
they're usually born out of necessity.
So if we look at the project in the
south of France it has seven members who
are unlikely collaborators in other
domains. So we have a project where
China, United States of America, Russia
and four other partners exchange
intellectual property every day on a
very high techch quest for fusion
energy. So you have to say to yourself,
first of all, why do they do that? And
how on earth are they allowed to do it?
How is the State Department uh allowed
to sign up to a deal where they're
exchanging information with Beijing and
Moscow? And of course the answer is
necessity. They need to collaborate
because no one of those members even the
huge powers can do that job on their
own. They don't have the resources, the
knowhow or the money to go independent.
You could have a Manhattan type project
for nuclear fusion but um it's it's
easier to collaborate where you provide
inind contributions. Everybody
contributes to the whole but you get
everything out. So it was born out of
the Reagan uh Gorbachev era. They
decided to sign uh bilateral agreements
first to get the show on the road. And
there was a wonderful statement at the
end of one of the Reichubik summits
where the Sherpers who were pushing for
fusion to get a foothold had Reagan and
Gorbachev sign an agreement which ended
with the words we agree to develop
fusion energy for the benefit of
mankind. But of course it was for the
benefit of each other also. And that's
the beauty of the ITA project. It's a
mini United Nations. It's in its own
protective bubble of funding.
And I believe that has enormous
parallels to what is going on now with
trying to get grips around AI. And if
you look at CERN, if you look at all of
the big science facilities,
they are
epistemic communities of experts who
collaborate to make something happen
that is very difficult to have happen on
their own. So I think that drive for um
essential collaboration
is going to hit the AI domain.
What is different between fusion energy
and AI that we can collaborate on fusion
energy
but maybe not on AI? The way I would
look at this is timing. If you look at
the iter project, the main agreement,
it's 21 pages long and it took 20 years
to negotiate. But if we'd been having
this interview in let's say 1950
and I would have come on and suggested
that
the United States state department and
its department of energy would agree to
a bilateral treaty with the Soviet Union
at the time ahead of forming an
international atomic energy agency. We'd
have probably both been arrested Sanjay
as communists under McCarthyism and we
were we were going to be traitors to the
entire system. But of course that's
exactly what happened and it happened
because
of the need to deal with the other
member states and to come up with a
grand bargain between the nuclear halves
and the nuclear have nots which led to
the IAEA being formed for it. There was
the need to develop a fusion device that
was going to work and that is a tokamac
which was originally a Russian idea and
there was collaboration amongst experts
about how that was going to be done.
There was an enormous argument and
negotiations over where the site was
going to be but eventually they formed
it around Katarash in the south of
France. the USA have been in and out of
that project, you know, in terms of um
people wanting to pull out and and keep
in for many years, but they've stayed
in. They've stayed in because of the
benefit of the inind system in that the
the money is spent back in the homeland
and there are senators for Texas and
California that will want to keep that
going, but also because of that fusion
community. So the fusion community and
the IT project are the same thing. There
is no plan B. There's never going to be
another chance for it. That's how
important it was then and still is to
the world. It's a very difficult thing
they're trying to do, but they are
gradually getting there. You know,
there's the standard line of they just
need another 10 years and another 10
billion dollars and everything's going
to be okay. But if you look on the IT
website, you'll see the progress that's
been made. But my argument is the
collaboration is almost more incredible
than the fusion
because of the members that are involved
and by the fact that the agreement was
made robust enough to get through the
ups and downs that the founding fathers
knew a long-term project was going to
bring. So it survived the Fukushima
disaster.
It has survived the Russian invasion of
Crimea.
It has survived the COVID epidemic and
the effect on supply chains and it has
kept going despite calls for funds to be
used everywhere else. It exists. The
IAEA has its critics. It is by no means
perfect. But its proof is it's still
there. We haven't had nuclear
proliferation beyond the groups that
everyone knows. We have got a safeguards
program. We have got an atoms for peace
initiative which is making a big
difference on if you like in comparison
to AI AI for good as well as what we
know AI can do on the other side. So
these institutions and these networks
are very robust and have to be because
of the pressures on them to collapse and
to fold and to not work. Do you think
especially in democracies political
perspectives change when you have
different administrations
each comes with a different perspective?
Is it because fusion is that critical
that or is is it not that important that
no nobody is giving as much attention
that we should be in there like climate
change people say I'm in or I'm out I'm
in I'm out. Just I'm just curious Mark
what is your thought?
>> So my take on that is let's stick with
the how is it gone through these ups and
downs.
>> I think it's also about personalities
and about leaders and about the um the
sherpers that make this happen. So with
the US the state department and the
department of energy have been sort of
on a they've been hot and cold at
different times. So you have to ride the
wave of the different peaks to make sure
that things are going to happen. And um
there were great personalities involved
at the time in state and with the
Russians with Bellikov the grand the
father of uh of fusion to make that
happen. Now you then build in to the to
the treaty to the IT convention very
tough terms and conditions to keep
everyone bound in because the founding
fathers knew there would be these
strains that you talked about. So, for
example, like all treaties and
conventions and agreements, you could
pull out any of the seven partners could
pull out. And there's actually been uh
there's a YouTube video where the
director general at the time, Bernard
Bego, briefed the uh the science
committee to Congress who were thinking
about this sort of action and said,
"Well, of course, you're the committee
of Congress. You can decide what you
wish, but it will be a terrible decision
for the USA for three reasons." The
first is the day after your papers are
registered in Paris to withdraw from the
IT agreement, you'll be cut off from the
intellectual property. So everything you
put in will be lost. The other six will
continue. The second is of course you
will be letting down a lot of your
partners throughout the world and it's
very difficult to see how Europe would
collaborate with you again on such a a
major undertaking. And the third is of
course you would lose all that work. The
homeland work that's done in California
and Texas and elsewhere uh would be
lost. So it would be a big mistake. And
of course these arguments are very
strong and that's why they stay in.
Climate is um you know the problem that
we've all got. Has it been addressed yet
adequately? By no means at all.
But the measures that have been taken
are helping. you know, you could say to
yourself, what would have happened
without the Paris agreement at all? So,
um, that's why if you if you look at
even something like the space station,
how does the space station keep going?
There's virtually very little science
comes out of it now. But again, I would
say the collaboration is more important
than the the station itself. Europe,
Russia, USA having to collaborate.
Roscosmos having to talk to NASA back
channels of communication, the next
space station gateway, what's going to
happen with that? So these
collaborations have a life of their own
and the IT organization like the IAEA in
Vienna have a culture and life of their
own which sustains them. And you have
leaders, you have great director
generals, you have great staff, and you
have communities that want to keep that
going and and be the success that it is.
None of these organizations or projects
are perfect by any means. And if you
speak to people at the IA, they will be
the first to say, you know, we are not
perfect, but they get an awful lot of
things right.
And that's why you know since 1957 here
we are in 2025 they just held their
general conference. It was a huge
success. It had atoms called water was
one of their themes. How on earth do you
have a room for the general conference,
the IEA? And in that room are the United
States of America, China, Russia, Iran,
Israel, Ukraine, all in the same room
negotiating. They make statements.
There are issues. There are problems.
But they make progress every year. They
collaborate.
the better side of human nature is
allowed to make progress.
>> Mark, you have called for an
international AI agency under the UN.
You published a recent paper. Walk our
audience briefly through your vision.
How would this AIA function differently?
Because there are quite a few existing
bodies. There are AI safety institutes
including one in UK and there are
several UN efforts. there is ISO, there
is uh you know ILE E, I mean I could
just name a bunch. Uh so that's just the
first question I have on that part.
>> To answer that, I need to just go back a
little bit in time. You may be familiar
with the panel that the secretary
general established in the end of 2023
which was called the UN highlevel
advisory body for AI. They were selected
from over 2,000 people. Brilliant
people. absolutely the top people. They
included a mixture of age groups,
demographs, industry, academics,
everything. And in the terms of
reference for that group, the secretary
general asked them to come up with the
uh means and and plan to form an
international agency for AI. They then
met over a year. They met in person.
They met remotely. They worked their
socks off. you talked to any of them
involved. It was an intense period.
Their final report which was in November
2024 was to feed into the summit of the
future in New York. But for me it dodged
the question they were asked in the
first place which was how can you form
an agency? Now why would that matter?
Why is that the essential ingredient?
And I come back to the difference
between how you govern
nuclear materials, nuclear safeguards
and everything around that sphere and
how you are trying to manage climate.
One has a central focus agency that
people can kind of hang their hats on,
focus around, have legitimacy and
focality
and the other does not. It has a lot of
well-meaning meetings. It has a lot of
herculean efforts and champions. And if
you look at what is happening on AI
right now, I would say uh it is almost
impossible to keep up to the pace of the
initiatives that are forming. The UN are
doing great work with the ITU, but as
you just try to catalog there and almost
by the time this interview is finished,
there'll be another initiative come out.
There are just a plethora of ideas,
governance initiatives, signups, red
lines, you name it. Everyone's trying to
get their arms around this problem. The
difference today to forming the IAEA
is back in the 50s, industry were
involved in the Manhattan project, the
fallout after that of the uh the
technology, etc.
But we're not directly in the
negotiation room. If you look at the
Bletchley Park safety summit that was
held in the UK uh which was a huge
gathering chaired by at the time by
Richie Sunnak who was the prime minister
at the time. You had many industry in
the room. You had industry in the room.
Microsoft were present at the summit of
the future in November in New York. But
of course they can be in the room and
then they can decide to leave it. They
can do good. They can provide
initiatives and then they can withdraw.
So for me until you find a mechanism to
have them locked in to what you're
trying to do, you're never really going
to have any hope of getting a grip on
the international governance and
regulation of AI. Now that is an
incredibly difficult task because there
is a massive risk of regulatory capture
if you involve them directly in the
negotiations. But to some extent they
are anyway because they're setting the
agenda. They are deciding through their
power and their wealth and their ability
and their goodwill
to go into areas of government uh
decisions that formerly they would have
got nowhere near. I'm a huge um fan and
um follower of Maricia Shaka who's the
professor of AI at Stanford and her book
the tech coup which talks about if you
look at this as a as a simple coup of
government features we should all be
quite pangry that we're allowing this to
happen and not only are we allowing it
we're applauding it and we are fating
the big tech uh mobiles uh during the
process. I am like a lot of people. I
love AI. I use it. I have three apps for
AI on my phone just here. I think it's
going to do incredible good for science.
In fact, I think science is going to be
one of the main quick beneficiaries of a
lot that they do. we can reel off the
benefits health education
you know but also I think it's in great
danger now of widening the gap between
the AI halves and the AI have nots who
of course that gap also mirrors the gap
generally between the halves and the
have nots now how did they get round
that with the formation of the IEA they
had the grand bargain which was not
between the US and the Soviet union at
the time but it was between the nuclear
halves and the nuclear have nots. Now
that grand bargain has been met in part
but not met completely. It had things in
it such as atoms for peace, the use of
nuclear power. What you have now is a
global south and a and a have not
community that is much more savvy and um
I would say bruised
than it was in the 1950s when it agreed
to the grand bargain. So you'd have to
come up with a system that not only
included big tech in the proposal itself
but also paid full respect to the AI
have nots. Now one of the things with
the formation of an agency is if you
look at that IEA that was formed
originally
it was very small when it was first
formed. It had sort of 70 people for
about five years. It operated out of the
Grand Hotel in Vienna for a long time.
There was then the Cuban missile crisis
and the state department and others
during that period sort of said you know
what we need is an international agency
and people pointed out well you know
we've got one sterling coal an American
is the DG it's in Vienna and it's
gradually built up and it is what it is
today to form an international agency
for AI I think would be incredibly
difficult I think it would be pretty
hopeless at the start but it would
gradually build credibility and have
focality and legit legitimacy over time
and it would in the effort to herd all
of the initiatives that are currently
going on which the ITU is doing, the
office odet within the secretariat of
the UN in York is doing which uh the
dialogue on global governance is doing.
You would have one area, one agency that
would do that. And the thing with me
Sanjay is I'm a kind of evangelical
no compromise unapologetic
believer that it is really inevitable
because of what AI is going to change.
People people sort of say oh you know
Mark you get it's a bit hype you know
you're joining in the hype here. I think
AI is probably not being hyped enough
and its impact is going to be quite
incredible.
And what we don't want to do is leave
the formation of some overarching agency
to be after some catastrophic event
where we then decide as humanity, oh
dear me, what we need is a is an
international agency. So how would you
even get that started?
Now this is where you may you may lose
some of the audience Sanjay because they
may say okay this podcast now has really
gone off the rails because I believe the
precursor will be that the United States
and China will need to sign a bilateral
agreement on AI. Now will it say a lot?
Will it cover everything? I don't know
but I think it will happen. You'll be
aware there's also there is already an
agreement between Biden and Z that AI
should not be used in any form for the
decision making regarding the release of
nuclear weapons. So if you look at the
essentiality of that accord on earth did
they agree to sign that because they
needed to. And I think every almost
every month, but certainly in the coming
years, it will be clear that America and
China will both benefit from signing an
agreement between the two of them about
AI because they're ahead. The US is way
ahead of all the others. But China is
fast catching up as we've seen with
development of their um LLMs. And I
think that that will happen now.
When will that happen? I've even been
bold enough to suggest in Trump's last
year
uh current last year of 2028,
I think he will sign a bilateral
agreement with Z on AI and I think the
American tech uh giant will support
that. Now, that's a big
prediction given the current state of
affairs on trade and on sanctions and on
everything else we can think of between
the United States and China. But I would
put it to you that's exactly the
position we were in in 1950 thinking
about signing an agreement between the
United States of America and the Soviet
Union at the time. So, it would be very
difficult to set up. You'd have to have
incredible leadership to make that
happen.
And in that leadership model, there are
two roles that are crucial. One would be
who the member states come up with to be
their first director general nominee.
And secondly, who would be the chair of
the board of governors of that body if
we follow the IEA's way of doing things.
And we can have great fun speculating on
how that might happen and who that could
be. then how it would work. But that's
my um kind of pitch. That's what the
paper is about. And
if I look at the high level advisory
body report, which was called AI for
humanity, their final report, it's got
some great recommendations. The seven
recommendations are in no way bad, but
at the end of the day, they didn't
report to the full general assembly.
their chairs, their co-chairs presented
to a side meeting of that meeting in
November and
I think some of them themselves were
disappointed that it didn't keep the
rigor of their um original task in the
interim report.
There's literally been initiatives in
the last few weeks linked to those seven
recommendations that are going to make a
difference and are going to help with
the global governance of AI.
But for me, they're nowhere near enough.
>> What is your big fear in proposing this?
Is it that AI is going to create this
massive inequality? Is that your primary
motivation? Is it it could get in the
hands of people who could create
biological nuclear weapons? Is it it'll
give one nation more uh power than
others? What would be if you were to
name one, what is driving you towards
this?
>> I think my concern is we have at the
moment a wild west where we're trying to
set up separate sheriffs to get a grip
of gangs of cowboys that are running the
thing. Now, they're running it, I would
say, on the whole responsibly and they
themselves don't want anarchy and they
don't want to market. you can't sell
into. But I think the winner of the
moment of the fragmentation that's going
on are the tech companies. It's not the
people.
And if you're Google and I have great
initiatives like the EU AI act, I have
um other initiatives all over the world,
then I am going to be affected by them.
I'm going to have to deal with them. I'm
going to have to comply if I want to do
business in Europe. But I'm massive and
I may find a way around some of those
regulations. Now, an agency is not
immediately going to solve all of that,
but you're going to have one forum where
it can be solved and where you're going
to be able to give people tasks to
figure that out and gradually work away
with industry as to how you're going to
get a grip of this. So I think the
danger is doing nothing in terms of
forming an agency for me is not an
option and there is you know it's it's
too it's wrong to say nothing is being
done now of course there's amazing work
going on by the UN by ITU by the UN
secretariat by industry by many actors
to get their hands around this problem
but I don't think any can effectively
work until you have a mechanism to
coordinate them and provide the
legitimacy, focality
and responsibility to have a place where
that is located. It's an opportunity for
the UN itself because the next secretary
general, whoever that's going to be, is
going to inherit a UN really in crisis.
It's in funding crisis. It has a hostile
US administration.
It has wars,
you know, incredible problems of um
refugees, everything you could name
under the sun. It's going to have to
reorganize. It's going to have to try
and have other ways of doing work. And
I think that is also going to be some
quite radical changes. this new
regulatory body that you're proposing is
concentration of power something this
agency will uh deal with.
>> Oh, I think it's an incredibly difficult
question. I think in the same way that
nations have to give up some degree of
sovereignty when they form an
international agency. Companies will
have to give up some degree of power in
order to contribute to an agency. Now,
why would they do it? I think they will
want to because it gives them an ability
to be in the room and round the table to
help sort out the only part of the
puzzle they cannot control right now.
And the part of the puzzle they can't
control right now is what is happening
with AI development everywhere else. Now
they will say they work hand in hand to
build capacity and to um work with the
global south and whoever to um build
that capacity but I think with
open-source models who knows how that's
going to go. Also, I think it appeals to
their sense of legacy. And if you look
at the real top tech um bros that we all
know and I think many of them who wealth
is no longer a problem or an issue, if I
look at companies, if we look at Google,
I think it's market capitalization now
is about equal to the 14th or 15th
wealthiest state in the world. Uh what
can you offer their their leadership
beyond what they've got already? and I
think a place in history and a place in
legacy and I think many of them do want
to do the right thing and I think that
is the number one driving reason for an
agency. So they don't want a disruptive
um dysfunctional system. So it's in
everyone's interest to make AI the AI we
all want it to be. Um the question is
how do we organize that and how do we
get on with it? And of course I would
say this but I think it's inevitable
that that is going to be an
international agency for for AI. So
there is going to be an international
agency for AI. International atomic
energy agency
has a verification uh process and
inspection process that they do with AI.
You're talking about different
jurisdictions
continuous ch changes. uh Mark I mean uh
you know just agentic AI multimodal AI
there is reasoning models and I can
assure you if we have this conversation
3 months from now there will be
something else how will your agency do
this kind of verification process like
the international atomic energy agencies
do
>> right so the honest answer to that is I
don't know but I think I know how they
will decide
So it's a much harder problem than
nuclear material. If you look at
tangible things such as you know where
are the stock piles, where is tritium
produced, how do you do that? AI is an
order of magnitude beyond that. But I
believe there will be methods to do that
and have inspections and also the
inspections that the IEA does are by no
means perfect themselves.
They are they are not allowed into every
every area but they do enough to keep
control of what's going on and the proof
is their continued existence. So Sanjay,
this is why you would need in that board
of governors the sort of people who
could answer that question you've just
asked because it will be incredibly
difficult to come up with a regime that
is credible and is allowed by rival
companies today to make sure that we we
have that level of scrutiny.
I still believe it'll happen because it
will have to because if we imagine a
world where we just let it
go as it is, we're trying if you look at
the gradual roll out of the EU AI act to
get a grip of that to look at the safety
cases to look at the models to to look
at the testing to look at how we train
the data and there's some great things
going on out there. So it's not as if
it's a blank sheet of paper how we would
start to control the use of people's
data to control the abuse of people's
data to control the abuse of people's
copyright. So there's you know and legal
cases are testing the boundaries of that
right now.
But those legal cases for example are an
irritation
for big tech at the moment. I wouldn't
put them any higher than that.
But if I now have big tech trying to
help me to solve those problems,
uh it adds weight and argument to how it
could be done. Will the Trump
administration
join in the call for a treaty for AI?
Well, after the meetings last week in
the UN, they put out a statement that
they would actually do the opposite. So
a treaty may be some way off, but that's
where it's ultimately going to end up.
Should AI development be slowed down
globally? Yes or no?
>> No.
>> Can the current patchwork of national AI
regulations succeed without
international coordination? Yes or no?
>> No.
>> Okay, let's make it a little interesting
for you. Will China agree to meaningful
AI governance restrictions? Yes or no?
>> Yes.
>> Should advanced AI models require
international approval before
deployment?
>> No.
>> Will national security concerns
ultimately
styy international AI [music]
cooperation?
>> No. The answer to your question is no.
Because I think they will actually lead
to it. I think national security
concerns will be part of the reason why
you will have to form an international
agency not the reverse.
>> Should AI governance prioritize
innovation over safety?
>> No.
>> Can small countries or have a meaningful
influence in global AI governance? Yes
or no?
>> Yes, with a massive why.
>> Should AI governance include binding
enforcement mechanisms?
>> Yes. Should the UN lead global AI
governance efforts? Yes or no?
>> Yes.
>> Like in the UN, you have proportionate
voting.
Will there be proportionate voting in
your II? Yes or no? A
>> very complicated voting system in the
board of governors of the IEA even to
how the members are rotated but they
have [music] no veto currently in the
board of governors. Okay. But there is a
general conference above that. So it's
it's the absolute key to how you would
organize it and it's very difficult but
it's doable to have big take with a vote
but not with a um overriding control and
member states reclaiming
the authority they should have which
they've given up. So it's it's
absolutely crucial how that would work
and [music] um would be covered in the
statute that we're going to draw next.
>> Okay. Final one for you. Uh yes or no.
Will your II have a system similar to
the UN Security Council where these five
countries kind of decide what [music]
the rest of the world will do and
countries like Japan and others are kind
of sitting outside.
>> Yes.
>> Yes.
>> Yes.
>> Yes. Because you ask me, you put me on
the spot because that is the real real
politic that will come in. The world
have not are much more savvy now to
allow this to happen at all. You cannot
form that agency by just the big five
deciding there's going to be an agency.
It's never going to happen. So you have
to balance you have to balance some
incredible
difficult things here. the powerful
member [music] states, the middle AI
powers, the global south and big tech in
probably the most difficult problem
facing the planet in a few years. How on
earth can you do it? It's going to be
very difficult, but you will do it
because we are clever enough to figure
that out and we'll find a way.
The global south can gain enormous from
the formation of an IIA.
The question is why would the big
member states and the tech [music] bros
what's in it for them? And I come back
to this
and not the anarchy that you may lead to
if you don't have it. We're not going to
have wild anarchy because we've got
regulation. We're doing what we can. But
you're not going to have that focality
and [music] legitimacy and the experts
together to solve problems unless you go
this route. So there's got to be
something in it for everyone and that is
very very difficult but nobody said it
was going to be easy.
Absolutely.
Well Mark you know thank you so much.
You know your vision for an
international AI agency represents
really one of the most concrete proposal
that I have seen for addressing global
coordination challenge and AI governance
and especially drawing from your decades
of experience managing international
science projects. Your approach you know
offers both the urgency of immediate
action and the pragmatism of proven
institutional models. [music] And for
our listeners the message is clear. The
window for shaping international AI
governance is open now but according to
Mark it won't remain so indefinitely. So
whether you are in industry, government
or civil society, you know the
frameworks we build today will determine
how humanity navigates the AI future
tomorrow. Mark, thank you so much. This
has been uh very very informative
session for me and for our uh guests and
we'd love to have you back again.
Thanks, Sanjay. I just want to say one
final thing. We do have a website. The
website explains the uh what we're
trying to do much better than my answers
did today. But I uh I enjoyed it as
well, Sanjay. And I'd be happy to come
back anytime you like.
