one of the most critical issues the
Achilles heel to this whole thing is
number one not only getting appropriate
databases that are both proprietary and
open
databases but you have to have enough
energy to actually power the databases
we're going to hit a critical point in
the next few years where the amount of
energy necessary to empower the huge
databases that we're going to need is
going to start to compete with the
amount of power it takes to to do the
the rest of the things that we expect in
the in the world today that has got to
be recognized as a a
concern welcome to the regulating AI
podcast join host Sanjay purri as he
explores the dynamic and developing
world of artificial intelligence
governance each episode features deep
Dives with global leaders at the
Forefront of regulating AI responsibly
tackling the challenges using AI can
bring about headon and enabling balance
without hindering innovation
welcome to regulating AI the podcast
dedicated to Bringing diverse Global
voices to the conversation on Fair and
Equitable AI regulation I'm your host
Sanjay Puri and today we have the
privilege of speaking with us Senator
Mike RS from South Dakota Senator rounds
is a key member of the bipartisan Senate
AI working group and the co-chair of the
Senate AI caucus with his extensive
experience in state and federal
government including serving as the
South kaka's Governor and now as a US
senator he brings a unique perspective
to the critical task of shaping AI
policy Senator rounds thank you for
joining us today to discuss the future
of AI regulation in the United States
well thanks for the opportunity and I
hope we talk not just about the
opportunities to regulate but the
opportunities to incentivize as well and
what we might be able to expect from the
development of AI here in our country
absolutely uh Senator we have a global
audience uh policy makers uh think tanks
CEOs of large AI companies small AI
companies AI enthusiasts so can you just
start by telling uh our listeners about
the Genesis of the bipartisan Senate AI
working group and its primary
objectives I'd be happy to uh first of
all we're doing this on a bipartisan
basis in the Senate because all of us
recognize that AI is here to stay it's
not going to go away uh it's been here
for an standard period of time and used
to call it machine learning and now some
folks have figured out that artificial
intelligence probably is more
captivating fact that chap GPT came out
um Sam alman's crew put that out and it
really woke a lot of people up because
it was available for people to to play
with and in doing so it made people
start to think about what the future
might look like and how we go about at
least letting people know what could be
done uh if we do it correctly and
incentivize it and grow it versus what
happens if we don't uh if we don't
recognize that it's going to be here for
a long long time so it's it's a matter
not only of what it can do for us but
then trying to allay some of the
concerns about what might happen if the
right types of of a regulatory approach
aren't included in the discussion in
terms of invasions of privacy or for
that matter on a more dangerous level
even uh what happens if it gets into the
wrong hands and it's used to create uh
weapons of destruction of mass
destruction and so forth so broadly
that's the reason why we started talking
about this on a bipartisan basis U
Senator uh Schumer uh Senator Hinrich uh
Senator young and myself and we decided
if we can keep this on a bipartisan
basis and we work this way through get
as much information as possible then we
also agreed that we would try to keep
all of the relevant committees in the
Senate looped in and to bring in as many
of the staff members as possible so they
had a comfort level in terms of what the
possibilities were with AI and just the
development of the of of of the
discussions around AI uh the the the way
we communicate about AI in general and
so forth so there was a comfort level
among staff in being able to advise
individual members about different
approaches and concerns that AI would
would have over the next couple of
years that's very helpful as you
emphasize uh the bipartisan nature of
this uh senator uh the working group uh
released the road map for artificial
intelligence policy what do you see as
the most crucial priorities that have
been outlined in this
document first of all we will try to
provide incentives so that AI
development occurs in the United States
where a light touch on regulation would
provide a couple of different
opportunities for development first an
understanding of what the ground rules
are for everybody in terms of how
quickly you develop the most power ful
tools and the fact that if you develop a
tool you still have rules and
regulations that are in place right now
that you still have to adhere to Simply
including the ability to do decision-
making on a more rapid basis doesn't
change uh the fact that somebody still
going to be held accountable if you do
something wrong with it if you steal
something with it you're still going to
be held accountable at the same time uh
to protect the intellectual property
that is being developed using AI is
important and if we'll make sure that
our rule that are in place today that
have served us so well in Western
culture recognizing copyrights
recognizing patents recognizing that
people can actually own intellectual
property and if you're developing it
with artificial intelligence somebody
can still own that I think that's going
to be an important part of making sure
that people want to develop here within
the United States um and comparing with
who's going to have the better types of
of a of a groundwork a framework uh
whether it be uh uh
Britain whether it be um you know the
folks in Europe through the European
Union or whether it be elsewhere in the
world uh UAE most certainly has a real
interest Saudi Arabia has a real
interest because of the amount of energy
that they're going to have available for
the development of data centers and so
forth but the question will be where
will those key developers want to
establish uh the most sophisticated
types of AI development and we wanted
this framework to lay out a path forward
so they understood that we took this
very seriously we want them to be
successful but we also want to make sure
that everybody kind of knows the Basic
Ground rules and another item and I hate
to go on but I gotta share it's really
important that we include the expertise
of the committee level um in in all of
these so that if you've got somebody
within Commerce that has got areas of
expertise that their input is allowed to
happen through the committee process and
that we don't simply do a gang of four
and put out a huge bill that doesn't
have the input we don't think any would
then would ever get passed into law we
did that so this way each of the
Committees will have an opportunity
whether you're talking the National
Defense authorization act through the
armed services committee or whether
you're talking the Judiciary talking
about intellectual property rights and
so forth all of them will have an
opportunity to have their input about
modifications to existing rules and
regulations well that's very helpful uh
Senator you said light touch on
regulation making sure Innovation
happens in the US and each committee has
an input in the ultimate framing of this
legislation Senator you serve on the
armed services committee and the select
committee on intelligence and so can you
discuss the National Security
implications of AI and how the working
group is going to address some of these
concerns let me Begin by the by the very
basic that that we look at in the armed
services committee today you have five
different domains in which war is
conducted air land and sea but also
space and cyers space and with regard to
the use of artificial intelligence
specifically in each of those areas it's
being Incorporated right now into
Weapons Systems the Neo kabach War which
occurred back in September of 2020 is a
good example of even small countries
utilizing certain aspects of AI to
attack others and to change the face of
War uh on on landbased uh systems we've
also seen that in the in the defense of
our own ships in the Red Sea uh where we
used very very highspeed systems to be
able to ident identify incoming uh
Vehicles whether they're attacking uh
shipping in the Red Sea area uh or
attacking our own ships artificial
intelligence is a part of those systems
today but even more than that it's going
to be used in the future with regard to
space-based systems and um right now the
decision making on a larger scale uh
with regard to how you track incoming
missiles that uh that are that are are
are you know capable of hypersonic
speeds you if you don't use artificial
intelligence to be able to do that you
can't keep up with the speed that the
weapon systems have on the other side of
it uh with regard to biological weapons
or cbrn in particular but but but
chemical biological nuclear weapons and
so forth artificial intelligence is
going to be used in the applications of
those and in the defense against them
when we talk about biological weapons
we're talking about the ability for a
bad actor using artificial intelligence
if they can gain it to create plague
type situations that might be used to
harm their their adversaries we'll need
artificial intelligence to be able to
identify as quickly as possible those
new biologics and to be able to defend
against them using vaccines that are
created literally in weeks or in days
rather than in months a good example of
that will be what we call Med Shield
which is an example of where we want to
be able to create vaccines as quickly as
possible using artificial intelligence
in connection with our biomedical
research centers we want to do that in a
fashion incentivize that development so
that when our adversaries and there will
be adversaries that will attempt it when
they do attempt these types of of new
plague type systems that we can identify
them uh find them and take them out as
quickly as possible just an example but
that's kind of what we're looking at
within the armed services committee all
of the other committees will be looking
at it as well and when we talk about
quality of life it's a different story
but I believe that using Ai and the
development of new new medical systems
new medical developments we can change
the quality of life for a lot of
American families and that can be shared
with people around the world I think you
covered a tremendous ground in terms of
autonomous uh weapons bio uh use of
weapons Etc but you talked about quality
of life Senator um how can we ensure
that AI benefits uh all Americans uh
including in rural areas part of your
home state has a large population of
rural areas and tribal policy is also
where you have demonstrated significant
leadership how do we make sure that AI
impacts you know all communities
indigenous communities
Etc Rising tide floats all boats and let
me give you just one example using guide
AI which is another amendment that we're
trying to put into the armed services
committee this year it would allow for
the development of biological research
centers and significant databases that
would be created to specifically
identify areas in which we can go after
different types of cancers just as an
example I believe that if we incorporate
the databases that we have today and get
as much information as possible into
those databases uh train the appropriate
databases and then allow it for research
and development I'm convinced that we
can cure the vast amount of cancers that
afflict man today and and I'll go a step
further I think it's not just a matter
of the the of cancer but I believe that
we can make an impact with regard to
Parkinson's and Alzheimer's as well if
we take the time now to invest some
money and granted anytime we talk about
investing money we're talking about
spending money people will always say
well is it worth it when you think about
the fact that older Americans today in
many cases those who are on Medicare as
an example are afflicted with at least
two long-term chronologic diseases we
spend 93% of our money on the two-thirds
of Americans that have those
chronological the long-term chronic
diseases if we can reduce or delay the
implementation or or the the ongoing or
the the oncoming effects of those
chronic diseases we can not only save
money at the federal level but we can
improve the quality of life of
Americans on a personal level my wife
passed away from cancer in in November
of 21 I saw the development of
Technologies at that time that helped to
continue her life for a period of months
I'm convinced that if we put the right
types of Investments right now into the
application of artificial intelligence
to make decisions more rapidly than ever
before and to work our way through with
with the medical field we can find the
right types of cancer treatments more
rapidly than ever before specifically
person by person and in doing so we can
stop cancer we can find the cures and
improve the quality of life that will
impact every single American family
think about what that means so today
that can be not just for Americans but
it can be for people around the world
and when you start to improve the
quality of life for people around the
world now now you've now you've really
impacted and you've confirmed that AI is
here to stay that's what I want to see
well that's uh very powerful Senator as
you said uh you know finding new cures
for diseases like cancer do you think
also maybe approvals of drugs could
become faster using AI Senator there
there is no question about it and and
look we have to modernize the way that
we do drug approval we can learn from
some of our our neighbors uh in Europe
about how they do drug approvals but if
you use Ai and you have a a a consistent
recognized matter that actually does a
really good job of vetting the
individual drugs the development of them
is going to rapidly move forward and
then you find the successes you take out
the ones more quickly that could have
harmful side effects but think about
what happened just in terms of any one
of those drugs that's being treated if
you can more rapidly develop them and
The Offspring from them each time we
develop a drug there's always the
opportunity to improve upon it the
decision making that goes into that is
critical if the Food and Drug
Administration can incorporate as a part
of their processes using artificial
intelligence to promate the prognosis
more quickly about how they're going to
be impacting the the general population
we can move those drugs through on a
more rapid basis that means also that
you can reduce the cost of introducing
those drugs as well now I gotta warn
everybody the one more thing about this
one of the most critical issues the
Achilles heel to this whole thing is
number one not only getting appropriate
databases that are both proprietary and
open databases but you have to have
enough energy to actually power the
databases we're going to hit a critical
point in the next few years where the
amount of energy necessary to empower
the huge databases that we're going to
need is going to start to compete with
the amount of power it takes to to do
the rest of the things that we expect in
the in the world today that has got to
be recognized as a a concern of we need
energy and and for the country for the
countries that are actually able to
produce the amount of energy necessary
um they're the ones that are really
going to have a leg up on developing
these databases and maintaining those
databases long term that's a huge part
of what we're not talking about enough
when it comes to artificial
intelligence uh two very important
points you made uh Senator getting drugs
in faster but also I think what you said
is the cost of producing these drugs it
takes about a billion dollars today
Senator to prod produce a blockbuster
drug now if the cost came down companies
would be producing them much more and
then you talked about the use of energy
where we need to look at alternative
sources also Senator it's it's more than
that it's in all of the above it we
can't we can't simply say we're going to
have alternative sources and then go to
items that are not continuously
available you can do everything that you
want to make uh it a more carbon less
environment but we're still going to
number one need to determine ways in
which we actually take carbon out of the
atmosphere long term but the second
piece on this is is nuclear definitely
has to be a part of this until such time
as a true space-based solar collection
system is available to us which would be
the purest form of energy that we could
probably ever get so I'm I'm convinced
it's going to happen maybe not in our
lifetimes but pretty close to our
lifetimes but in the meantime we have to
develop appropriate nuclear uh energy as
well or we're not going to keep up with
the demands that artificial intelligence
is going to want but with the energy
that's going to be expected by
populations throughout the world as well
yeah so nuclear I think Senator what
you're saying is going to be an
important uh source for US senator you
emphasized the importance of Workforce
considerations in AI policy uh what
specific measures are you proposing to
address potential could be a lot of
people have talked about Job
displacement and the need for
upskilling yeah look there's never been
a major development of of advancement
with regard to whether you're talking
computer systems or whether you're
talking just moving into Machinery
versus hand labor you've always had a
displacement or a change in the types of
workers that you need but you still need
workers now training those workers and
providing them with an opportunity to be
very very valuable that's something that
we should never dismiss it's something
that we have to recognize our education
systems are going to have to recognize
that these needs are there but at the
same time recognizing you still need the
Artisans you still need the folks that
understand how Plumbing Systems work how
electrical systems work you need the
Hands-On folks that can actually get the
job done in many cases but the
manufacturing processes are going to
change you're not going to need as many
people building widgets necessarily or
putting widgets into systems but you
still need the folks that are going to
take care of the Machinery that does the
widget making or the widget
distributions and so the jobs are going
to be there the opportunities are going
to be there but individuals I believe
will become even more valuable in the
workforce if we provide them with the
appropriate training and that
appropriate training means taking an
individual that may have a basic
education but allowing them in an
appropriate setting to advance their own
capabilities to be valuable not just uh
in their own right but to an employer as
well and I think you're going to find
more individuals that may not need an
employer anymore they may they may
actually be the employer themselves as
they offer their own services in a world
in which everybody is connected so yeah
do do I see some displacements out there
absolutely but those displacements have
always occurred they may occur more
quickly with the development of AI but
the opportunities for people to get
ahead in this world are also there so
yeah we'll see some displacement but
we're going to see real opportunities
for advancements as well so some
displacements but probably even larger
and bigger opportunities uh where
companies can really play a role
probably community colleges uh Senator
can play a role rather than just
fouryear uh college degrees I think is
what uh the message is no question about
it and look we're not having enough kids
today the way it is just to maintain our
own
populations our TFR right now in the
United States is Clos to about 1.64 you
need 2.1 just to break even uh China's
in terrible shape they're below 1.2
right now Europe is probably you know I
think in some cases closer to the uh to
the developed War Europe is closer to
the 1.26 region um those areas they're
not making enough babies to actually
replace the workers that are there today
um so yeah we're going to need people uh
and and we're going to be inviting in
people uh to come into the workforces in
the developed countries the
opportunities are there uh AI is going
to enhance those opportunities and
they're going to make people more
valuable so from my perspective yeah it
could go south on us if we don't manage
this correctly but I think if we
recognize the need for education and to
advance that education such a fashion
that AI is a part of
it I think we're going to be
okay awesome uh Senator you talked about
the Europeans the Europeans have passed
the EU has your working group uh
collaborated with some of our
International Partners given the global
nature of AI we are we're talking with
each other we're learning from each
other we hope to learn from what Europe
Europe did both the things that they did
right and some of the things that they
might have over regulated which might
very well send some of their topend AI
companies to the United States in order
to avoid some of that some of that
regulation we're learning from them now
they're going to be learning from us as
well uh but we're talking with one
another we're going to try to learn you
know Britain has a safety Institute uh
I've heard some really good things about
what they've been able to do with regard
to how they've identified how to keep AI
safe and and how to limit uh some of the
more destructive nature of AI we want to
learn from what they've done because we
need to do the same thing here in the
United States the folks that have
expertise in AI here in terms of how you
regulate the most high-end and how you
restrict some of it from getting into
the the bad guys hands we can learn from
what from what Europe did in terms of
what those are in terms of the values of
some of those systems and how you
identify what is a what some people will
call a frontier end of the of the AI
development we've got more to learn on
that but uh what we don't want to do is
to over regulate and chase people away
from the United States we want to be
seen as a location where you can
continue to develop the AI capabilities
profit from them uh but make sure that
the quality of life is improved because
of it as well so learning from uh what
they've done right and maybe what
they've not done right uh Senator you
had along with Senator Schumer some of
these AI Insight forums that have been
fairly groundbreaking what were some of
the most surprising or impactful
insights you gained from these sessions
this is for our audience who are not
prev to some of those sessions we did
nine different Insight sessions where we
invited folks from a spectrum of
different companies big and small folks
that represented labor folks that
represented Healthcare folks that
represented the technology side of
things and we' bring them together and
we did them behind closed doors but we
invited all of the Senate staff and the
senate members to come in and listen to
what they had to say I think the one
items that the items that that that that
I personally saw in this was number one
how much each of the different
businesses had in common whether they
were big or small number two the
concerns of that labor had were of make
sure that there's educational
opportunities and and make sure that
that AI doesn't displace folks without
place to go that's what I got from some
of it I I also learned time and time
again that yeah there is going to be a
need for regulation uh and a need for
some reporting form but that's going to
be on some of the most advanced AI
capabilities and that AI what is the
most advanced now six months from now is
not going to be the most advanced and
that also we need energy and that energy
is going to be a huge part of where
these databases are at that the
databases them eles if it's garbage in
it's going to be garbage up so you've
got to have really good databases and
that there's a need to do both the
proprietary databases and you have to
have open source databases as well and
the ones that will probably Advance the
most quickly are going to be the open
source databases but you still have to
have the proprietary databases because
of the types of information contained in
them those are some of the things that
we learned uh universities we most
certainly want to have access to it and
across the board
all 50 states here we want to make sure
that everybody has access to these tools
and that uh students can learn from them
that the uh the the folks who are doing
research have access to them and that
our National Labs be included in the
development of the AI strategies in the
future and then finally uh once again
I'm G to come back to this the quality
of life that we can show the American
people specifically beginning with
Healthcare is huge and that if if we do
it correctly we can not only save money
at the federal level for treating
long-term chronic diseases but the
quality of life and the Improvement of
quality of life is going to be
huge challenge that we also have to
recognize is that we will have we will
have folks that have uh long-term
indebtedness because of the institutions
that are going to be changed uh with the
treatment of healthcare and that systems
that are going to rapidly change are
still going to have to be paid for so
you're going to have this incurred debt
this stranded cost that's going to be
out there that is going to have to be
dealt with but we can't let that stop
the development of these new tools um
that over a period of less than a decade
will really change the face of what
Healthcare is going to look like in the
United States and the quality of life is
going to be improved some amazing
insights uh Senator that you have given
our audiences uh energy is important we
want Innovation uh we want regulation of
some of these very potentially high-end
systems uh but quality of life I think
we hear that from you that quality of
life especially in healthc care is going
to play a huge huge role um I think that
is very very important because for some
people who were not behind those closed
doors uh one of the questions that came
for you Senator was that AI is moving
very very rapidly every day there is
some something new you know you have all
kinds of things agents you have
multimodels Etc
uh legislation regulation doesn't kind
of move at that same speed uh let so how
do you balance Innovation and regulation
kind of together because we you might
put some regulation today and AI is
going to look very different two years
from now that's correct and and and I I
mean I'm really glad you bring it up in
that in that respect I think the
industry has to at some point
participate in almost a self-regulation
in some areas we can lay out the broad
guidelines and and make it very clear
that there are going to be certain
boundaries that are not going to be
allowed to be to be stepped over with
regard to the most capable AI systems
without Federal regulatory approval uh
those are I'm going to call them for
lack of a better term the frontier
systems the most expensive systems and
we know who can produce those today and
and those organizations are working with
us today uh the largest with regard to
to whether or not they can actually
license to to to export those products
those
capabilities but down the line and and
this is the part that I think is is
important on an ongoing basis you have
to have an industry series of standards
and a safety standard similar to what
Britain has done put together by
industry using industry experts who come
in and participate in that in that
regulatory oversight that's going to be
critical so you can have like a testing
Institute like the like what we call you
know for for other metrics and so forth
we have that right now uh at the federal
level we can incorporate an AI portion
at that Federal level with regard to the
testing just like we do for pipes or
just like we do for fittings for uh any
type of mechanical processes that are
out there today we can do the same thing
with regard to to identifying for AI
purposes or for machine learning uh a
similar type of limit as far as
Communications protocols and so forth
that can be done right now the large and
small companies I think are all going to
participate in that type of a deal but
um that exists right now in in the
Department of Commerce we'll want to
make sure that it incorporates an AI
working group as well into into that uh
that kind of oversight uh that the
industry will participate
in that's a being told that I have to
stop okay so finally uh Senator thank
you so much for this insightful
discussions on the complexities of AI
regulation uh the challenges are
significant but as you have pointed out
Senator the opportunities for the
quality of life and healthc Care is
incredible we really appreciate your
time and your dedication to this
critical issue and to our listeners
thank you for joining us on regulating
AI stay tuned for more conversations
with global leaders shaping the future
of AI policy thank you so much Senator
this has been fabulous thank
you thanks for tuning in to the
regulating AI innovate responsibly
