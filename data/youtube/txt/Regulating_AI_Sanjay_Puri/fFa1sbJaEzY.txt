Welcome to the regulating AI podcast. We
are live from the ITU AI for good
conference here in Geneva, Switzerland.
I have a fantastic guest with me, Hovic,
who is with the UN refugee agency. Hi,
welcome to the regulating AI podcast.
Thank you for having me here. Hovig,
please tell our global listeners about
the UN refugee agency and about your
role there and how did you come to that
position?
Um, yes. So, I um I've been now with the
UNCR, the UN refugee agency for almost
20 years. Um, we are the United Nations
mandated agency for refugees. So our
role is to ensure international
protection for refugees and also we're
one of the biggest humanitarian UN
agencies in the world. Um I started this
journey long ago. Um I've worked in many
countries on the African continent and
the Middle East mostly with our uh
humanitarian response. So building
refugee camps, managing refugee camps,
uh negotiating with host governments,
working closely with refugee
communities, uh who we are paid to
serve.
Um so I've played many roles in UNCCR.
Um the my most recent role because come
before coming to Geneva I was the head
of Mosul office in Iraq
during the war in 2016 uh 2019 where we
were supporting internally displaced
Iraqis fleeing the war and since mid
2019 I've been heading the innovation
service for UNCCR and our role in the
innovation service is to help both
refugees and UNCCR teams innovate. uh we
collectively face very complex problems
and the role of our innovation service
is to help refugees and our teams solve
some of those complex problems.
Well, it will be a surprise to a lot of
them including me that there is an
innovation office within the refugee
office of uh UN. So that is fantastic.
Is what role does artificial
intelligence AI play in this UN refugee
office?
Well, for us AI is a disruptive
technology.
Okay.
But for us, all technologies are a means
to an end and not an end by itself.
Um, and so obviously with the
advancements in AI, because we have been
actually experimenting with AI for a
number of years now,
uh, even before generative AI,
but now obviously with AI, with
generative AI, things have moved faster
and, uh, solutions are now much more
sophisticated. What we're using AI for
is to improve services to refugees.
That's one element of how we are using
AI for good.
So, we work very closely with refugee
communities um in the analog world. Our
added value as a UN organization
mandated to support refugees
is to be close to refugees. Um wherever
I've worked, we're the first sometimes
the first ones who meets a refugee
crossing the border. Mhm.
That proximity of the relationship
allows us to better serve them.
Mhm.
And over years we started getting better
at collecting the data.
Mhm.
Analyzing the data so that we can better
serve them.
Now we are using AI to optimize the
analysis of that data. uh so that we can
let's say establish feedback mechanisms
to hear their complaints or their
suggestions at a faster pace to solve
some of the challenges that they have at
a faster pace than we did before.
So we're definitely using AI to both
improve our services to refugees but
also improve our understanding of
to improve the services to them as well
as understand them. Hovic the population
of refugees worldwide has grown
dramatically in the past few decades and
it just keeps growing on the number of
displaced people around the world. Is AI
a technology when you look at chat box
and other things that can really provide
the firstly that ability for them
because now you can scale up
dramatically with this technology
because with the numbers of refugees
going up obviously you can't just keep
incrementally growing the staff because
it requires funding. What kinds of tools
and technologies are you using? tell our
listeners I mean I'm just thinking uh
from their perspective because you could
be using agents you could be using chat
bots may I'm getting ahead of myself now
I'm getting excited but tell our
audience what you're using or not also
could be down the pike because that is a
pretty exciting thing because ultimately
how can we help the refugees
yes and I think this is a there's no
straight answer into is does this mean
we need less people. Uh the answer is
not necessarily
and I'll tell you why.
To deal with more people.
Yes. Because what has happened over time
is you know in the analog world.
Mhm.
Uh refugees would have to come to our
offices
physically.
Physically line up
in the camp. It might be in refugee
camp. It might be easier because it's in
closer proximity,
right?
But most refugees live in urban areas
not in camps. So for them to come to our
office was difficult. Sometimes people
have to walk for kilometers before
reaching UNCR.
So over time what did we do? We started
call centers.
This is even in the what we call the
analog world.
Call centers have had improved our
reach. So people would start calling us.
Then we started upgrading our call
centers. Uh a few years ago our
innovation service tested third party
messaging apps like WhatsApp for example
which is the preferred channel of
communication for refugees globally. Uh
but by using their preferred channels of
communication like WhatsApp in the
digital space what happened is that the
volume of people reaching out to us has
increased.
So yes the numbers are increasing but us
opening digital channels of
communication has also increased the
volume of demand.
Now a few years ago we started testing
chat bots. So that's another layer
but um most people have individual
complex cases and so whereas chat bots
could answer simple questions we want
the human in the loop.
So you will end up first of all not
discussing confidential information on
third party messaging apps. So yeah, so
as as I was saying, we you know, after
we established the call centers, we
started using chat bots which then
allowed us to answer frequently asked
questions.
But then most people have an individual
case, an individual grievance, an
individual worry,
something very particular about their
case.
And so you need a human in the loop. You
need then a human to talk to them. Mhm.
We don't want to exchange with refugees
on third party messaging apps on very
confidential issues. So we will
establish other channels for us to talk
to them even including a family visit.
We go to their place um etc. So that's
the another kind of area where things
have grown. The number of people we're
getting to know using digital spaces is
very high. But you were mentioning also
uh when we're talking many people have
the drive to be connected
but it's not given in the last mile. So
we have a connectivity for refugees
program that is trying to help 20
million refugees connect to the grid by
2030. This is together with the ITU and
GSMA.
Wow. We need to solve problems like
access to devices for refugees to be
able to connect with us and with their
families back home but also with
humanitarian actors so that we can
improve our services. So that's the
second layer which is the chatbots.
Now we are at a stage where we are using
AI to identify bottlenecks in our
service to them process of feedback so
that we can solve those kind of
problems. So we're getting better at
transitioning from the analog services
to the digital services and AI is kind
of speeding the process up. What
roadblocks do you see because this is
where I feel
that AI and technology is really I mean
we can talk about all the other great
things. This is where we are really
impacting human lives here. What
roadblocks do you see that are hindering
what you would ultimately like you like
there's a few thank you for the question
uh one is I was uh uh alluding to it is
uh the access of refugees to the grid
right
so the more we have communities
connected the better we can serve them
so one big roadblock is the access to
the digital in the last mile
satellite
satellite or other means of
connectivity.
Mhm.
But um in the last mile we have many
refugees in remote areas in the world
where connectivity hasn't reached.
Okay.
Devices are still too expensive.
Refugees need connectivity not only to
be in touch with the rest of the world
but it's also um a means to solve their
own challenges. We have launched for
example a project on digital employment
for refugees. Imagine refugees, Syrian
refugees in Jordan working for a Finnish
company remotely.
Refugees have that commitment and they
want to do this. There's there's this
craving for education, but if you don't
have connectivity, if you don't have
laptops, you will miss out on the
opportunity. So, I think one element is
the infrastructure. The more investment
we have in the infrastructure where
refugees live, the we can speed up their
digital access to it. There are also
legal impediments. Sometimes refugees
don't have the even the right to own a
SIM card. So we're working with
governments also on legal rights, the
right to open a bank account.
There's a misconception about refugees.
There's a lot of misconceptions. One of
them is, you know, reliance of
assistance. People don't want to rely on
assistance. They want to lead a
dignified life. But if you can't open a
bank account, how can you work? So we
also try to pacify those kind of legal
barriers for refugees to to have access
to to the digital world.
Um we also have uh resourcing issues on
the humanitarian side.
Technologies cost money.
Um and with dwindling resources
um it's very difficult for organizations
to invest if we don't have the
resources. Hence the need for us to work
with the private sector. We're working
with many companies who are here um in
uh at the AI for good summit uh because
they have a role to play in uh equaling
the playing field working with us to
reduce cost of uh access to technologies
and solutions so that we can better
serve uh refugees and dispace
populations. There's also the idea of um
not parachuting technologies on people.
Mhm.
We are very keen. We we have a
refugeeled innovation program that
invests in refugeeled organizations
innovating. So we give them both
financial support and technical support
for them to lead the innovation projects
they want wherever they live. They live.
Um so we believe that communities have
to be part and parcel of the design of
AI solutions.
uh some of the challenges lie in
institutions, entities developing
solutions elsewhere and trying to
parachute those solutions or test those
solutions on communities. We are not
part of that club. We believe that we
the solutions need to develop be
developed together with communities
ethically respecting human rights values
and principles and making sure that the
communities we serve are fully
knowledgeable about the solutions we're
developing.
So you said basically uh the grid being
a uh a challenge a device sometimes they
don't have device um in some cases it's
legal impediments because uh you know
there is not clarity across the board on
rules and laws can they open a bank
account or not. Um and then obviously uh
parachuting
technologies from outside rather than
going ground up.
Is mobile payments and things of that
nature playing a role in
Absolutely.
It is
absolutely and we we are using digital
digital currencies more and more. Mobile
money is whatever is possible is used by
us and many other organizations. So,
we've I think we've gotten better at the
mobile money component,
but you you you're never perfect. We
always improve the way we we do our uh
programming. So, that definitely has um
goes far, but I think the answer to that
is the financial inclusion of refugees
wherever they live. The ultimate goal is
for them to have the right to open a
bank account, have access to jobs. uh
mobile money is a means to that end.
It's a bridge towards
it's a bridge. Yeah.
As we as we build the bridge, we need to
also build the infrastructure on the
other side so that uh eventually our
cash distributions need to stop. They
cannot continue forever. U but what
happens when you stop a cash
distribution where refugees don't have
access to jobs?
You know,
they again fall into very difficult
situations. So I think the whereas we
are keen on our humanitarian response
and our assistance, we are also keen on
making sure that refugees have the
resources and the capability to live a
dignified life without humanitarian
live a dignified life.
Is there an opportunity to reskill?
Because AI is now hot and there are a
lot of need for AI skills. I could be
wrong. Generally refugees tend to be of
a younger demographic. So maybe their
adaption for mobile for AI would be
better and I know maybe that's not your
office in terms of innovation but
giving some reskilling opportunities. is
what we can
certainly absolutely and we are working
on it. Actually we have uh launched what
we call IDEA which is the inclusive
digital economy alliance which is about
uh refugees having access to a digital
economy. What does that mean? It means
infrastructure so them having access to
connectivity laptops and whatnot legal t
right to work
skilling and reskilling
job matching. Uh I was in Rwanda not
long ago and I met with a group of um
young refugees who we had a digital
employment um project with them. Some of
them already have their companies
established.
Wow.
And what they need is contracts so that
they can first make the company work and
hire more refugees. So the demand from
all of the refugee communities I have
worked and in Africa and Middle East,
but also all the work we do in Latin
America and Asia and even in Europe, the
demand for skills is high. The zeal to
work is very high. Um, you know, I come
from a refugee background. My
grandparents were Armenian refugees in
uh in the Middle East and I know how
hardworking my grandparents generation
was because they were refugees and they
had to you know
life was difficult and they had to
defeat those challenges. So the drive is
there.
The question is
do does the rest of the world have the
willingness
to lend a hand to work with these
communities? Uh the potential for
reskilling and upskilling is very high.
uh as you said um very young populations
eager to learn languages in many of the
camps I've managed we have language
schools we have IT uh IT skills uh
sessions etc it's just that we need more
investments in that domain and um not
only skilling there's a lot of skilling
and reskilling that happens many
companies come and skill refugees
question is not whether skills it's the
choice
because if you skill A few years ago, I
was managing a camp in Jordan, Zaran for
Syrian refugees. At the time, coding was
the fashionable thing. Now it's AI.
Coding's going away.
Yes. But at the time, at the time,
coding was the fashionable thing.
Yeah.
Many companies came to the camp I was
managing and they would all of them
wanted to code. And I would say, great,
but what next?
Oh, well, we were just going to do the
coding. What are they going to do after
you teach them coding? Well, that's not
our
not that that's not our specialty. I
think that's that's the problem. If you
look at any challenge from a very myopic
way, you just look at one element of the
problem, it's very difficult to then
achieve results. So skilling and
reskilling is very important, but it has
to be in a context that you're thinking
about what next. And what next is what?
Jobs.
Access to the global digital economy.
The more we give access to refugees to
the global digital economy, pacify the
hurdles, the easier the solutions would
be. And then you would have more
communities who are willing to be
reskilled and upskilled because also
people see when you have a a portion of
the population in the camp all received
coding uh skills and then none of them
are working. That's not a it's not a
also a good example.
Kobic finally I'm probably taking you in
a direction you your innovation office
is not but you now got my mind flowing
data labeling is a very big thing for
artificial intelligence where you know
the internet data gets labeled with
certain tags and categories a lot of
that work has been done in Africa and
other places uh which is where you know
the foundation companies and others are
doing it Because AI needs huge amounts
of data, data that is makes sense. Is
there an opportunity to do some kind of
a public private partnership with these
organizations because they need help and
they're looking for help from people
with language skills with expertise
uh those kinds of things. Do you does
your organization do public private
partnership?
We have an opinion about this first.
Yes, we we do uh and we're very keen on
public private partnerships. So, we know
we can't do it alone
and as I said earlier, we work with many
private sector companies. I think for
us, what is very important is the
refugees have access to
all of the different ranges of skills
and jobs
uh that the global economy offers. What
we don't want is refugees boxed into
lowpaying
jobs that are also uh not necessarily
respecting the the dignified working
environment and whatnot. So as long as
it is within uh global efforts to bring
uh opportunities to refugee communities
across different layers of let's say uh
data services or digital services then
we feel more comfortable. What we want
to avoid is uh all of the pitfalls of uh
let's say in the analog world the sweat
shops. We don't want to take that into
the digital space. We want refugees to
have dignified jobs as long as they have
a potential for growth as long as they
are fairly paid um and fairly paid
according to the local economy
obviously. um as long as the intention
is towards that um we're very willing to
work with with partners but we want to
avoid the pitfalls of uh what we see in
the global economy. We don't want
refugees to just be a u a means to cut
costs and box them into a certain
workforce category.
You know that makes sense. Uh you don't
want to box them in. You want to give
them mobility up there. Hovic. Uh, I've
learned a lot. Maybe Hovic, we should
not, we should stop calling them
refugees. Maybe that's something to
think about because that's become a
little bit of a perception issue. Uh,
they are just talented people. Um, but
thank you so much uh for being on the
regulating AI podcast and thanks for the
great work you're doing for the
displaced people is what I call at least
I think of them around the world. uh and
how AI is transforming in some ways
their lives.
Thank you for having us.
Thank you so much.
Yes.
