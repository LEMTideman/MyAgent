Welcome to the ITU AI for good
conference in Geneva. We are live here
at this amazing conference. We are
thrilled to be having Dr. Kathleen
Kramer who's the president and CEO for
ILE E. She brings an incredible
background of not just academic
excellence but also practical insights.
She's been a professor of electrical
engineering at the university in San
Diego as well as she's had tremendous
experience working with viaat hullet
packed and many other organizations. So
we're truly lucky to get that balance of
how academics and practical experience
is going to we're going to talk about
transformation that's happening in the
workforce and talent etc. President
welcome to the regulating AI podcast.
Thank you. I'm really happy to be here
Sanjay.
Great. Um, we are at a very pivotal
moment uh in AI. Well, I think we said
that last year. We might say that again
this year. But again, for our listeners
who are global, what does responsible AI
mean to you as a president of the
world's largest uh technical
organization?
So,
everybody agrees it's like world peace.
we're we're we're all in favor of it and
the difficulty is defining what we mean
by that and at the same time allowing
the future to happen
and so uh we're at it e we have been
working at least I've been personally
involved since 2017 and I think before
that
but long before it became the coolest
thing in town we've been working on that
and we see it as uh we're devoted to
transparency
privacy and concern with human
interaction and so we can provide
frameworks for that but in the end you
your AI is not going to do adjudication
for you it's not going to punish people
for you it's not it's people act in
their individual interests and so our
notion is to form communities and to
provide accepted standards
pro uh provide communities and provide
standards As you said u different people
have different definitions but president
ILE E has been ahead of its time. You
got almost 100 such AI standards. Now
you've got a certification program which
really focuses in on algorithmic bias
and transparency etc. How does this talk
to our listeners what does that
certification mean and what does it mean
for the workforce in your view? Well,
so there has been along with the AI and
similar
innovations um transformations.
Um
the it's hard for education to c
education versus training. We could
debate all day the difference between
education and training. It's hard for
education to catch up with that. And so
to have meaningful So what does it mean
if I tell you I have a master's degree
in AI?
What does that mean? It it literally
means nothing. And and so to have
Well, to all the people who have
master's degrees in AI, Dr. Kramer,
I've told you that it means nothing
because it it literally means nothing.
Uh, and so anyone, any institution can
put up a sign that says
master's degree and you can name a
degree program anything you want in most
countries.
And so what does it mean? And so
certification
provides some reassurance uh a level of
quality and that's what certification
accreditation uh efforts along those
lines that's the important point of them
is to have a meaningful credential
rather than a credential that has
literally no meaning. Yes. Sorry.
No, but u you raised a very important
point uh president if I may just follow
up on that.
MBA or NMS or take some of those degrees
now are codified standards of what we
do. Ex
uh exa exactly and so uh one of my
qualifications and my background is I'm
I'm actually a fellow for an
organization called AET. and AED
accredits literally several hundred
programs worldwide in I think it's about
80 countries and then we have something
called the Washington Accord that covers
several other major sources and for
certain types of degrees say uh
electronics engineering
uh computer engineering there's a
meaning to what it means right that in
order to call yourself that and to say
that you're accredited whereas these
newer emerging technologies it can be
very appealing to have a degree and
particularly graduate degrees so an MBA
for example they have an accreditation
body and there is the highest level of
MBA accreditation body and you can tell
whether or not it's in the club or not
in the club whereas in general master's
degree today can mean many many
different things
many many different thinks uh we have
listeners who hear about $100 million
packages for people who have these uh AI
skills. Are you saying that we need some
form of accreditation for the masters in
AI?
I I'm saying that the state-of-the-art
today is that that doesn't exist.
Okay. And so
the appeal of the great so there is
great demand and great opportunity for
real experts but how do you know an
expert from a non-expert and then
particularly and it happens more so than
not with computer affiliated
fields that you're told you know you can
do this virtually you can do this online
and
it's it's very difficult to provide
quality. And so um our certification is
not a degree. And so we're generally our
genuinely our entire focus is advancing
technology for humanity. And so um
that's all we're doing it for. And so
education has been one of our major
emphases from the beginning. and we're
141 years old this year. Um Thomas
Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, uh
Nikolai Tesla was in our first class of
fellows. And so we're really interested
in helping advance technology and so
part of that part of the keys to the
kingdom is education. That's why you're
asking me about it.
So do you think with your background you
said you know you work with Abat you're
obviously teaching uh and now the
president of this 141 year old
organization. Yeah. 500,000 members in
190 countries.
500,000 members in 190 countries.
Among some people, I'm very well known.
Of course. Of course. Uh and there are
people who on in our audience who know
you or will know you now.
Should there be changes
in the education curriculum? You kind of
are talking about that. Yes.
Because this is
truly transformative technology.
Actually I I completely that that's a
very true statement and there is a
fundamental there are fundamental
changes coming and there's this tension
that true education as opposed to
training.
True education really is not a big
endeavor. So if you're if you're looking
to help the learner to learn and to be
successful, that's not a
a a that's not the way to great wealth
and riches for the provider of the
education for it. It it certainly can be
the keys to the kingdom for the
individual who's a who wants to be a
technical contributor. Um we we've had
education has really suffered. I think
co um in many ways knocked down
it it brought in a future but it was in
many ways a very dark future and so to
force every force almost everyone to go
virtual in education when
it the technology just wasn't there to
provide that quality. And then the the
grit sort of the personal
uh the the personal
resilience to to learn how to learn when
it's hard to learn is a is a very
difficult thing and the reaction to co
changed approaches and it made many
things distance or virtual learning uh
with the argument being that it can be
just the game. All you need is the
lecture notes and all we need is someone
on video presenting and you need that
interaction. You need that commitment.
You need that modeling and so definitely
I e on on many fronts. Um I I wrote an
article that appeared this month and we
have a magazine called it e spectrum
that reaches our 500,000 and more and uh
I encourage your listeners to take a
look for one e for education. and do a
search on that
of course. So I think you made some
great points uh president
your you had a recent survey in terms of
the skills that are most desirable for
AI.
What uh struck me uh president is that
the second largest uh skill that was
required was ethical uh skills which
came in at 35%. Number one was software
development. Why is ethics AI ethics
such a hot issue or should it be an hot
issue?
Well, I think it's it's definitely a hot
issue. It's it's certainly a hot issue
here at AI for good,
of course,
but
um I think it's a lot harder uh than it
seems. I I I think for some people it
seems like an easy thing to understand.
I think AI is difficult to understand.
It's not
It makes hard things simpler for the
user, but for the developer, I don't I
think it's more difficult. That's the
these jobs that you mentioned that are
so lucrative and so promising. They're
not looking for the gentleman that spent
20 minutes on the internet watching a
few videos.
Um they're looking for genuine
expertise.
That's difficult. And so ethics is one
of those things like I mentioned the
world peace example. It's one of those
things we all agree that ethics is
important
right
and so the question on ethics and ITE
people don't aren't aware of this but we
essentially invented engineering ethics
with the first engineering ethics code I
think it was 1912
and engineering ethics is founded on the
fundamental principle of your
responsibility to the public and the
responsibility to have genuine expertise
that what you're selling as an engineer
is your knowledge that people can trust
in your knowledge and that's today when
you bring up our credentiing and the AI
you see exactly that coming forth and so
this is the fundamental principle
computer ethics which it's not that
computer
technologists are are less ethical than
engineers but computer ethics was is on
the principle of privacy and property
not that it wasn't conceived when they
first started working with computing and
and software, it was not conceived that
lives are at stake in the same way that
building a bridge, it's obvious that
lives are at stake,
right?
Yeah.
Uh President, there have been uh
conversations uh different different
people have come out, different
organizations. In fact, recently uh the
lead the head of entropic which is a big
foundation company talked about large
number of white collar jobs that will
get displaced because of this
technology. You have come out in saying
that there will be transformation but
newer jobs will be created for our
listeners who are very concerned in
terms of this
and we all agree there is a
transformation right?
Yes, we absolutely agree.
But you're saying newer jobs will be
created. explain what do you mean? What
did you mean by that?
Well,
I I there the transformation is coming
and the transformation is here.
Mhm.
Um I see it as you know if you go back
even 15 years ago so pre AI
um that everybody looked around and said
the transformation is here
because
companies no longer were your company.
So you mentioned, oh, you worked at
Viasat, you worked at Hugh Packard, you
you worked at I I don't know. I don't
know what was on your list. I also
worked at Northern Telecom. I also
worked at TRW. Of that list, they're not
all still here. and and uh you don't
have the opportunity even a highly
qualified really smart person and in
even no matter what country you're in
uh you don't have that opportunity to
graduate and now you have a job for the
next 50 years until you retire. Um, you
have to be ready that you are in demand
and turning down opportunities
from because you've developed your
expertise and that's an individual
responsibility
to maintain you. It really it no matter
we have many companies that are very
ethical and they care about their
employees, but in the end they're
they're operating for profit as a
business and their first loyalty is to
that business and it's not necessarily
making you a more valuable person to be
stolen by another company. And so who is
responsible for the for the next you
that if in six months the company that
you're with their technology just
doesn't pan out and doesn't have a
market um where will you be and so who
who's going to who who needs to care
about that and so at it e we care um and
so we see it as we're we're the
professional home for our members and so
we have you know different areas of
emphasis. And I see AI jobs as being
that way. I see jobs in technology as
being that way that you know what you're
so expert at today. If it's just a list
of very specific skills that only fit
this one product,
that's not a you're not building a great
future with that. And so we have to look
beyond that. And I I think the same
thing applies to AI except AI is yes,
it's going to replace let's say your
low-level programmer. There won't be
nobody wants the programmer that really
can't program anymore. The one who was
kind of getting by by copying everybody
else or looking for libraries. That's my
my my weaker students. No offense. um my
my weaker students uh when you give them
a programming assignment, you'll end up
getting uh work that they found in some
library that was posted somewhere of
coding and wherever it came from and and
bit github or etc and and they'll say
well I solved the problem like you asked
me to do you know whatever task I asked
to do and it's like you're missing the
point you need to be able if you can't
contribute on your own if you can only
copy
you you're not a valuable person in the
long term.
So for the young people who are starting
out a career um
yes
what skills would you emphasize for them
to take advantage of this positive
transformation because there's people
are afraid of them.
It's up to you to make it positive.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But what skills should they be
emphasizing it? We used to be saying
stem stem STEM stem STEM
for several decades. Is that still true?
Um I I gave a keynote actually for the
whizzywis
uh just yesterday morning uh three three
three minutes and I mentioned this and I
was given in my talking points to say
stem STEM STEM is so important and STEM
yes STEM as a category is important but
I definitely it you need quality in STEM
and So that's what going back to
circling back to what we said earlier
degrees need to mean something and so
given that your specific technical
skills so programming in cobalt which
doesn't exist anymore um
what else do you what can you do from
that how do you learn how to do it so I
go back to first principles I myself I
was a double major in physics
wow
and um why was I a double major in
physics it's never done me any good
except I brag that I was a double major
in physics, which is that's useful, I
suppose. Um, but it reflects a mindset
and and I see it as a mindset, an
innovation mindset. And so we're not
just about so copying like so yes, we we
use the term leverage. So you want to be
able to leverage what's valuable, but to
be able to have the discernment to see
what's valuable first principles. So the
for the harder class. The ones that
people say are harder, that's that's the
easier ones,
you can do that on the video. That
that's not a the time is our only zero
sum game in life. And so you only have
limited time. They'll kick you out of
school even if you want to stay in
school. And so pick the hard things that
you can't learn by yourself that you
could get the opportunity to work with
really smart people and be part of the
smart people club.
Pick the hard things. That's what uh the
president is saying.
President uh we talked about
transformation E is playing a key role.
Do you think government has a role in
this
with weather policies because this is
major major major transformation.
So by definition, people don't realize
this. So it's if someone's not involved
in policy at all, and of course I guess
maybe all your listeners are super
policy won. So good for so good for
them.
But um for your average person, and it I
think it relates to your question
earlier about AI ethics and that
interest in ethics. For your average
person, they like the idea of ethics.
They like the idea of policy, but real
policy is more than an idea. And you
have like like it's it isn't policy if
you don't have government. And and so
this is a difficult tight rope to walk.
And uh in particular we've had a
significant effort in it e so in the
United States uh a couple months ago we
had congressional visits day
and every year for the last few years
there's been a significant increase in
the participation in that and what I e
will do is we'll train the people that
come to they sign up to participate and
it's free and and And so we'll train
them in what are the policy issues that
are most important that we see as most
important but in the end what can you
advocate for on policy but what you're
passionate about. So these these I e
members are not our lobbyists, they
we're helping connect them to policy
awareness. And we have um I don't want
to say the wrong number, but I'll say 12
sorry I'll we have 12 different policy
committees with a with about 300
volunteers that are working on
particular policy interests including an
AI policy group. But um and so sometimes
people from say Australia might say well
the a Australia is not in the United
States policy group
because you and I know that's it's not
policy.
If then that's an interested group.
That's true.
Yeah. So we have we have policy
activities and we just created last year
the global policy caucus and then we use
the term caucus deliberately. Um, we had
the global policy
commit. I'm forgetting there were two
C's. The global policy committee.
Um, and
in that sense, but it's it's like a it's
a contradiction in terms if you will.
And so they were like sitting around
saying no uh to people because everybody
can veto everybody else as you see, you
know, the United Nations kind of thing.
And so by having a caucus, we can bring
together people that are separately
doing doing policy and help encourage
others. And so this is a an an exciting
event for us. Uh and so it just uh we
started on this journey this year.
That's true.
Yeah.
President, you've seen some
transformations happen in your career.
Yes.
Whether you look at uh internet, whether
you look at mobile technology, cloud and
so many others. Not that I admit to
being past 29.
No, of course not. Or let's just put it
this way. You've heard about other heard
about it other transformations that have
happened.
Yes.
How does this compare or does this feel
different than the other ones? This is a
question we get a lot.
Well, um I I definitely see it as like a
major
benchmark uh for lack of a better term
to come to my mind. Um, and so way back
when I was negative something, the I you
could see that computer and
communication were coming together,
right?
And then in the early 2000s, you could
see that this internet and eventually
the cloud
was really coming together and changing
things. And there was a dramatic change
in jobs where from a technologist point
of view where it went from the hardware
emphasis to the software emphasis and
companies like biosat I'll pick on bios
let me pick another company I'll pick
another company so so other companies um
would say I have to be honest with you
and this was before I was a president so
I have to be honest with you Kathleen um
90% of our recent hires were in software
And and so then our people or my
technology people were respond to that.
They respond to the demand by you end up
driving more and more and more to head
over to
software type majors, computer science,
etc.
Last couple years, I've been seeing it
coming. Um and AI has had the effect a
major effect
of uh changing the demand in a negative
way
in softwares in the in terms of the
effect on the demand. And so there's all
these graduates and some of whom are
thinking oh if only my degree said AI on
it that would make a huge difference.
No,
it's it's it's a difficult skill to
acquire and quick computing skills don't
prepare you to develop new work in AI.
So, it is it's definitely a challenge
and I I agree with you that um this is a
major change. It's a ma it's changing
technology in major most significantly I
would say in the autonomous realm. Mhm.
Um, and some of my some of my work is in
the aerospace realm, and there's a real
difference of culture that we're willing
to tolerate
accidents
in autonomous cars, but we're not
willing to tolerate accidents in aer
aerospace realm.
Yeah.
And and this culture of safety. So, and
it's it's, you know, sort of who's
driving the bus, the the the ethics of
computing or the ethics of engineering
and obviously we want those to come
together.
No, absolutely. Finally, uh for our
audience, what is your vision for ILE E
for 2030 moving forward?
Uh well in the end
we see ourselves as a trusted source
and so the trusted source for technology
and literally the tagline that I've
mentioned advancing technology for
humanity. So we are a public charity and
so we're a public charity that's also
the fifth largest publisher in the world
and we organize I believe it last year
it was 2360 conferences
and and so I don't go to all of them
um and each of those conferences has its
own community and so we're I I see
um
it's it's a challenge to have
communities of particular technical
interest and to really move the world
forward with technology. So there's the
technology impact on humanity and then
there's our ability to advance
technology in a positive way which such
as AI for good.
Excellent. Well, that's a great great
segue.
Since I'm having so much fun, I'm just
going to ask you for a a one-word answer
on a couple of things. Put you a little
on the spot. Uh, President,
go ahead.
Okay.
AGI or super intell whatever the term
is. Is it a a decade or decades away?
When you say like define that word for
me that you
which one ETI?
No, AGI. Oh, AGI meaning automatic.
Well, you know, artificial general
intelligence.
Oh. Oh, okay. Okay. Um
I I think I could argue never, but All
right. Um I think that it's not as close
as people would like to say. I'm I'm
gonna I'll be a pessimist, but in some
ways an optimist, if you will. So I see
the value of the human and in the end I
think that there is an ultimate value
for the human. Uh amongst my aerospace
people we see it as a never.
Okay.
And so so
definitely we have we have robo taxi
cabs now but in terms of like the true
human we're we're we're nowhere near
that point yet. Uh, next one up is the
biggest impact of AI. Will it be in
health care or education? Pick one.
Oh, definitely healthcare.
Okay.
And so in education, it's been misused.
And there's a look for easy answers
when, like I mentioned earlier, it's
it's grit and resilience and
understanding that you need to have
trial and error and efforts and and to
hang in there and expect to fail and do
the hard things. A a AI has been largely
applied in education like we're going to
we're going to and it's it's actually
listed as uh the grand challenges of uh
engineering. We're going to have
personalized learning. We're going to
teach you uh only what you need to know.
We're going to cater it. It's not it's
not up to you to change yourself and
make that effort. We just need to find
the perfect learning. No, no, no, no,
no. Whereas on health care, we've had
um a complete there has been vast
amounts of money spent on medical
research,
but on meaningful healthc care outcomes,
we have been completely lacking in a
scientific mind. Um and I I I'm pointing
at you public health policy people.
Okay. Just as a follow on even though I
said one word uh
are you against personalized education
because that's the big thing in AI that
every student is different
why should some they all be taught the
same things in their classes.
I so I would say I I'm more I'm less in
favor of that
okay
than uh you would expect. I guess it
would be an unexpected answer. I think
that that's a very appealing notion.
And there's certain appealing notions
that have unintended
negative consequences. And in
particular, the the notion that, well,
I'm just not good at this. And so, you
need to adjust it to me. And we we've
seen this in preAI, you've seen this in
a lot of ways that, oh, I just can't I
can't do this, so you need to change it
for me. I can't do that. So, you need to
change it for me. And there's only a
there's a limited amount of change it
for you that should happen. And I think
there should be an effort and like I
should I there should be an expectation
of effort and and so yes there's people
that need personalized uh accommodations
for example but in the end you need to
be a strong contributor that's able to
learn on their own not just get a mark a
check mark that says you're you're
special. we're gonna just check it for
you or set the bar so low that it's
impossible uh not to be successful. We
have so many I have such a big
organization that a lot of times I'll
the the we always have what are your
metrics and so people have learned
unfortunately that they have a slide
called metrics but they don't
necessarily have metrics that are
meaningful and sometimes I'll I I will
point I will point that out well you
have this slide called metrics but if
you look at it from what would be your
find that this is not successful and
that you should pivot and try something
else. You've set it up so that it's
you're you don't want to fail so that
you can't fail. So, how are you going to
learn and do uh you know do better and
improve and innovate?
That's uh pretty helpful. Uh president
AI is AI going to be a job killer or a
job creator? Uh it'll certainly kill
some and in the end we'll have we'll
have in the end so you know you saw this
with every major technological jump
advancement you saw that a whole bunch
of jobs so we don't have many jobs for
people working with horses
and and uh and nowadays the we have
there's certainly mechanics but it's a
much more limited
uh opportunity than it used to be And so
yes, there those there will be jobs that
will be eliminated and particularly sort
of autoquick, you know, the copy and
paste type jobs.
I just I just came up with that. I agree
with like so the copy and paste type
jobs, but that but that just makes it
more necessary to be able to do the hard
stuff and to be able to learn the hard
stuff on your own.
Yeah.
She does not like control C, control V.
If you've not if you've not figured that
out finally open source or closed
source.
Uh I
I'm talking AI now.
Yeah. So I I'm big on open source but
closed source um so if you're open
source you involve a lot of people and
so that's just kind of the nature of it
e is to be pro open source. On the other
hand, if
people should be allowed
to not be open source and if they want
to do their thing, um, some of the be
some of the greatest innovations are
done with your own personal motivation
and in a capitalist mindset and I I'm
I'm all for that, too.
Well, President, thank you so much. This
has been an amazing insight to our
listeners talking about education, the
changes in uh workforce in terms of what
people need to be motivated. Thank you
for being on the regulating AI podcast.
It's such a pleasure to have you.
Oh, thank you. I've really enjoyed it
Sanjay
at the ITU AI for good summit in Geneva
live here. Thank you so much.
