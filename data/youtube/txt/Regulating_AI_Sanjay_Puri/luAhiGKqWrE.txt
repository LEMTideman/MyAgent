welcome to regulating AI podcast uh we
are joined by Mr Boris Tadich he was the
president of Serbia from 2004 to 2012 he
brings a tremendous background in
Psychology and also has led his country
during an very critical uh time of
transition we are here to talk about
artificial intelligence governance and
many other things we are at the
international sping Forum hosted by the
club D Madrid and welcome to the
regulating AI podcast for us thank
you um Mr President you have SE uh seen
some incredible Transformations but your
background in Psychology and
governance what what synergies do you
find in artificial intelligence with
that background can you just let our
viewers and we have viewers around the
world United States Europe Asia Etc a
lot of them are policy makers so please
let them know a little bit about that we
are living on the crossroad in many many
aspects but one of the most important
Crossroad we are living in is a
technological
Crossroad uh many people are talking
about uh New World orders and something
like that but I think it's an even more
important technological Crossroad
because this is very fast process the
process um I'm not sure that we can
adopt ourselves to this process mhm uh
enough and it's a very specific process
attacking on human brain mhm uh our
habits and uh especially on the older
generation I'm not sure that uh my
generation is going to able even to
understand what's going on uh and we can
be witness uh very very specific moments
in the history of human uh beings and uh
I'm I'm I'm pretty sure that this kind
of synergy has to be in the focus in
next few months not few years that is
going to be too late uh right now I'm
coming to the from the panel when
my friend from being from the remin
university has been mentioning in neuro
uh networks uh which is very important
that this which is in fact foundation of
the artificial intelligence we can see
Synergy from the different Sciences
different human activities and that
Synergy is going to be mentioned as a
artificial intelligence but I think that
Foundation of everything is a kind of
Neuroscience neurons and the relations
between neurons and how we are going to
function as a aspect of that
neurological uh
functioning so uh you made couple of
very important points uh Mr President
you talked about the rapid change that
is coming in a lot of the companies that
are you know the leaders in artificial
intelligence they are focused on what
they call you know artificial general
intelligence where the artificial
intelligence becomes as smart if not
more than the human beings that's a
major change which will have profound
implications which you've kind of talked
about now you have lived through some
major
changes what do you think needs to
happen and you kind of touched on this
from a leadership standpoint around the
world to prepare for these kinds of
changes there will be changes in
employment there will be changes in
National Security and health and
others what would be your advice to
other leaders and you just had that
panel how do you how do they deal with
that change good news that Antonio guier
Secretary General of United Nations was
initiative
initiated kind of the process in which
we have to define the rules about
artificial intelligence MH without uh
defining roles and how we can use
artificial intelligence in the modern
world we can be in a very difficult
situation right but uh it artificial
intelligence is a more or less m machine
learning mhm but I'm always insisting
about what is foundation of machine
learning mhm this is a neuro aspect and
uh maybe the researches in um in kind of
Neuroscience are going to be even more
important in the future having huge and
even bigger impact on artificial
intelligence and all other aspect of our
functioning uh in in a global Arena now
day and this is why I'm uh suggesting to
my colleagues to be very careful and to
understand we are living in the world
which is on the crossroad that means the
future world is going to be more
probably very very different from the
world noway in all aspects in terms of
economy in terms of Education in terms
of uh uh profitable businesses in terms
of democracy in terms of governing um in
terms of understanding uh of how common
values I'm I have concerns that maybe
even our common values are going to be
redefined in accordance with the
technological Improvement uh if we are
politicians if we are political leaders
we have to be aware about this but I
don't see many political leaders that
aware about this many people are
mentioning artificial artificial
intelligence but I'm not sure they
understand huge impact of artificial
intelligence and finally
maybe we're living in a in terms of
governing in in a very different era in
which uh the classical
politicians and the Democrats are going
to disappear from politics and maybe
people from new technologies new
technology companies are going to come
to the power because they have
instruments in their in their hands they
have a significant tools that can change
whole landscape in politics now day wow
uh you made some very very important uh
interesting points let me just take the
last one that you said you said that
maybe the class of leaderships or the
type of Global Leadership is probably
going to be changing from maybe a
political to more a technological
leadership in your view is that good bad
because there are concerns at least in
some parts of the world especially I can
tell you in the US and others where you
see some of the social media or
technology companies have now got a lot
of power in what you see what you learn
what you
do
um that's a bit challenging from that
perspective because they're dominating
those kinds of things artificial
intelligence is even a step more um what
should governments do to make sure there
is some kind of balance here Mr
President
I'm not sure not sure right okay what we
can do I'm not sure what we can do
because we have to see in the very
recent period of time what is going to
be final outcome of that very fast
development and to react in a proper
time in the proper way and soon as po
possible but to be very Frank with you
I'm thinking what we can do and what we
have to do uh maybe few months ago I was
thinking that we have to do this but
right now in accordance with the new
researches I think that we have to do
something very different and uh we have
to analyze situation and to predict what
is going to be without imagination we
are not going to be able to predict
without um kind of specific skills in
creating new architecture we are not
going to be able to react in a proper
way and this is why I think that we have
to have a more Forum at are going to
bring together people from technological
companies from science and politics to
think what we have to do and how to
react uh right now few months ago I I
had a meeting with a with a vice
president of Interpol coming from
Nigeria and he mentioned to me that uh
most talented uh people in organized
crime worldwide are right now coming
from the poorest African countries
because because they're recruiting by
organized crime they're very good in
cyber crime and they are very efficient
and okay they're coming from the poor
countries they are looking for a chance
for better life and uh organized crime
which is I
mean not stupid yeah but smart is
recruiting most talented people and
they're coming from the countries uh I
mean we don't have a even idea that
people from Africa are going to be a
leading person in organized crime but
right now we are facing with such a
problem because Africa wasn't in the
focus of global arena for many many
years right but right now we have a new
challenges we have to think about that
we have to help Africa right now the
poor countries and the countries that
are undeveloped or countries that were
humiliated by many many years yeah
because of trauma which is uh destroying
almost whole societies and to think
about future of the Mankind we have to
take even this into the consideration
what we have to do we have to do a lot
of things but we are on the crossroads
really and we have to be able even more
than ever to imagine a world in which we
are going to live in next two three five
10
years so what you're saying is change is
happening and it's happening at a much
much faster Pace um Mr President uh
during your time uh uh in your country
you are able to
successfully have good relations or have
relationships with the United States the
EU China Russia
Etc artificial intelligence has become
more like a sovereign you know uh it's
become a national security or n
Sovereign uh issue it's like that any
suggestions as to given your uh
incredible experience in balancing how
does one balance it
because it's become you know either
you're with us or you're with a
different camps Etc any thoughts on that
oh Serbia is a in very specific geost
strategical position and having very
complex history we are always saying we
are able to to produce uh more history
than we can consume and uh in that
respect Serbia can be always factor of
instability but I wanted to see Serbia
as a factor of stability system
integrator on the Balkans and in a
regional aspect we are not big country
but sometimes even very little countries
are having huge impact on on the history
I mean Serbia has a impact on the
history uh the beginning of first World
War uh this is something that has to be
taken into consideration seriously not
only about Syria but also about other
countries we are facing with a many many
conflicts but right now coming back to
to to my country and how we we been deal
we were dealing such a complex foreign
policy issue uh I consider uh European
union membership as a main strategic
goal mhm which was inevitable from my
point of view in that moment 2 or 20 12
European Union was a kind of dream one
of the best option mhm it
was it's a still but in a very different
context right now European Union is not
that strong like it was don't not that
stable like it was not that um
independent like it was right now uh
having in mind the conflict Russia and
Ukraine European Union is going towards
more towards United States and but but
in that context European Union is losing
the position of interl and to be
mediator and this is problem second if
we are analyzing Global situation we
need a more countries able to be
interlocutors right now this is surprise
it's maybe China only interlocutor in
the global Arena uh no one was counting
on China only 10 years ago to be
interloc to remember what China has been
doing in terms of relations between
Saudi Arabia and Iran mhm but we need a
more
interlocutors uh Serbia wanted to be
kind of interlocutor but on the on the
lower level Regional level sorry but uh
I'm reminding myself when Yugoslavia was
a founder of non Alli movement which was
very important during the Cold War era
MH and but what I see we need more
interlocutors the countries that are
going to be mediator interlocutors to
explain really intention of some other
countries and to be in the middle of the
conflict and to work together on finding
solution in terms of uh sustainable
peace reconciliation process better
understanding communication this is why
my policy towards main strategic goal
European Union but at the same time very
good and strategic context uh of our
relations with United States Russia and
China was very useful I think I see the
the current president of Serbia is
trying to follow that agenda right now
in a different context but I think that
such a policy can be very important
still I truly believe that my country
has to become member state of European
Union even though European Union is not
looking like uh that uh uh Regional
grouping 10 years ago 15 years 20 years
ago and but we don't have a better
option but at the same time we have to
be careful and to take into
consideration our role even in European
Union on the regional context and to be
helpful in terms of solving Global
conflicts because because we have a huge
extremely painful experience being in
the conflicts many many years
you also uh were very active in terms of
education for the Youth when you look at
the world just
globally uh artificial intelligence is a
complete change in many ways what would
you recommend to your colleagues your
other leaders how should they prepare
their emerging population for this new
uh technology that is coming you you
were successful in doing that so
president what would you say to them
first of all I see a lot of
opportunities in terms of implementing
artificial intelligence in the context
of developing education MH uh for
individuals and for the Nations for the
countries MH uh that are facing with a
problem less educated people mhm uh at
the same time I see uh kind of
trusts for example the last researches
are telling us that uh uncontrol contr
exposure to the G digital content very
young people can
even destroy their brain parts of their
brain I mean I'm talking about very
young people and every country every
government has to take this into the
consideration uh right now we are living
in a very unmatured
uh atmosphere in which many people and
especially politicians are thinking okay
we have artificial intelligence we are
living in digital era we can uh we can
find the solutions for better and very
fast developing Better Living standard
but at the same time we can make many
many destructions on the on that way one
of them is uh new content of the TV m
movie industry it can be very dangerous
regarding very young population in that
context artificial intelligence can be
used in a proper way in totally improper
way and this is my first suggest
suggestion at the same time we have to
improve Educational Systems uh I used to
be professor in the high school also
many many years ago uh and uh I'm
thinking about that uh I mean if we have
a process of learning in which we have
to memorize cont I'm not sure this is
best possible option we have to trigger
kind of brain activities that are going
to bring individuals uh to the position
to make to
create good
decisions and to understand substance of
the processes this is very important we
have to be focus in education on that
not on memorizing more even though
memorizing is also very important but we
have machine that can help us somehow we
have to memorize very important facts
but not everything and and I see on the
universities elsewhere uh still
professors are insisting on memorizing
the content and but not on on the the on
the process of creating good decisions
and and process of understanding the
substance of the of of of the of the
phenomenas and this is my my main
suggestions I see very good development
in different countries I see India MH
making fantastic progress
I see some universities in China making
fantastic progress and also I see
Finland which was a champion in
education for many many years no one was
expecting Finland is going to be that
country but this is very important
because uh even the countries that were
not on the top in terms of Education can
come very fast in that position and this
is I mean I'm talking about the period
of the history of mankind that we on the
crossroad but something is a very very
positive we can we can make fantastic
jumps in our history and to create
better development very fast but this is
also high- risky situation that has to
be taken into consideration
seriously so obviously lots of
opportunities but challenges in terms of
I mean you mentioned young people Etc
one of the things that has happened and
you know we just had an election in the
US and there have been so many other
elections this
what artificial intelligence uh can do
is you know you've seen the U fake news
and fake videos and things of that
nature the speed and the quality of that
uh information that can come out um all
you need is a laptop doing that the
worry is how will is that going to
impact on Democracy around the world
especially given what AI can do it can
replicate you your conversations saying
making you say things that you never
have said
Etc uh there have been a lot of
discussions in terms of what can we do
whether it's watermarking or other
Technologies when you talk to other
leaders of democracies Etc is that a
concern or what are your thoughts on you
know uh the use of artificial
intelligence and Technologies as far as
elections and democracies are concern
still not many politicians and political
leaders are fully understanding all the
impact of artificial intelligence on
theh uh future of the Mankind and
especially on the future of
democracy uh we are talking about uh
different aspects of uh technological
Improvement we are talking about
artificial
intelligence
uh Neuroscience internet internet of
things meta wor M and something like
that and uh we talking about the new
technological companies
mostly majority of them are in United
States mhm and uh because I'm traveling
a lot I'm talking with the people in
different countries different continents
different big Powers MH I see kind of
concern and they see they see the trends
and every single country which has Capac
capacity to be more independent not only
big Powers but Regional powers and also
some smaller countries are right now
thinking whether they are going to build
their own browsers their own companies
their own internet uh and uh uh I see
the challenge how we are going to be
interconnected in the future because the
the main advantage internet is bringing
in our lives is that uh by uh using one
click we can be connected with the
knowledge mhm and experience Global
Experience which is fantastic but at the
same time this is the shortest way and
the easiest way how someone can make
influence on our way of thinking and our
process thinking yeah which is very
dangerous MH and taking into
consideration last researches in
Neuroscience we can see that impact of
digital world on our process of creating
decisions even during the election
process can be extremely aggressive and
very dangerous MH and I'm not sure that
we are going to W witness democracy in
the in the classical form in next few
years but we have to think if I mean My
My Philosophy is if we cannot defend
ourselves from the power which is coming
which is inevitable let's accommodate
ourselves to the new era and let's
integrate uh some kind of U the
guarantee Insurance within Democratic uh
architecture that can uh preserve the
problems that are coming in the future
because I mean the influence in in the
technology is not only in the power of
the good people right influence uh can
be in the in the hands of the very
dangerous people mhm we've been Witness
wiing uh many times in the history of
the mankind that the dangerous people
took a power in their hands sometimes
even mad people but we have to have a
more guarantee Insurance in the in the
world now day because we are living in
extremely difficult
interesting and uh fast period of the
human history and that means we have to
be very careful and to think fastly but
efficiently and to be focused and we
have to be able to understand what's
going on and to mobilize people from the
companies from business Arena from the
science politics and to find the
solution for the new challenges we are
facing with so obviously we have to move
fast we have to be very careful we have
to think very carefully because things
are moving very very fast those are uh
very very good suggestions um um Mr
President
finally for our audience which is
global would just some final words or
thoughts or advice that you have uh for
our listeners who focus a lot on
artificial intelligence its governance
its policies with especially with your
background I'm I'm coming from the from
the family of the science mhm and they
learned me that human beings are always
able to be be adaptable mhm to
accommodate themselves for the new
situation I hope this is true I hope
this is true but I'm not sure they had
they had in they mind such a process
which is incredible which is really
incredible maybe I'm fascinated with
this process even more that is
necessarily mhm
but my school of to is a telling me that
we have to be very fast and very much
concerned about further development my
suggestion is to think
about uh things we are facing with to
have a critical opinion critical opinion
is very important always and but
mobilization and the fast reaction is
right now even more important uh but uh
this is always very
problematic how to fast how to react in
a fast enough and in a proper way when
we don't have a enough time to think
about changes that are going to happen
in the future this is this is this is
main challenge
nowaday well react fast but react
carefully I think that's the message uh
that you're giving to our listeners uh
thank you Mr President thank you for
being on the regulating AI podcast your
background in Psychology governance
especially during some very challenging
times uh gives a great perspective to
what is truly a transformative
technology it's changing how we live how
we work and it is going to do so more so
uh we thank you for being on the podcast
and thank you to our listeners really
been a pleasure to have you sir thank
you very much for opportunity to talk
with you Sanjay and with the people that
are following your podcast
