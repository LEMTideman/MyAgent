the industrialized World particularly in
the United States we're in trouble we
have remarkable debt build up we have a
demographic curve we're getting old very
fast and along with a number of things
we have to do we have to get
dramatically more efficient and we have
to cut down cost externalities I don't
think society's completely ready for a
natural language um voicemail you get
that sounds like your grandma or a video
like this where someone has taken our
language
and changed us so unless you have a
revolution in the cost of providing
Health Services of making our brothers
and sisters healthier I don't know how
we're going to finance it it really does
consume everything in its path to read
and read and read and then read some
more the world is moving very quickly
around
us welcome to the regulating AI podcast
join host Sanjay pury as he explores the
dynamic and veloping world of artificial
intelligence governance each episode
features deep Dives with global leaders
at the Forefront of regulating AI
responsibly tackling the challenges
using AI can bring about head-on and
enabling balance without hindering
[Music]
Innovation welcome to another episode of
regulating AI where we delve into the
complex landscape of AI regulation with
global leaders and experts today we have
the honor of Hosting congressman David
schwier from Arizona's first district
he's renowned for his extensive
legislative accomplishments and advocacy
for Innovation and economic growth with
his vast experience in areas such as tax
reform healthc care and Technology
Congressman schwier offers unique
insights into the intersection of AI and
public policy join us as you explore his
perspectives on the challenges and
opportunities of regulating AI in the
21st century David welcome to the
regulating AI podcast Sanjay thank you
for having me wonderful David can you
tell our audience and just to give you a
little idea of our audience our audience
is global um we have uh had members of
Congress we have their staffers
listening in we have
ai CEOs and a range of other people
listening and can you tell them what
first sparked your interest in AI in
artificial intelligence um I I've had a
um both an interest and a little degree
of expertise in blockchain MH um e
distributive Ledger design you know
splitting data sets and those things for
Security even before coming to Congress
um so you know that's a decade and a
half ago and in a weird way I sort of
saw the designs of stacks and other
things in the um AI the chat world as
sort of the the next layer of the use of
Technology um and I also need to give
you my overall all framework of of
technology and this is from you know how
I feel about synthetic biology which I
have a fascination with to the adoption
AI
is the industrialized World particularly
in the United States we're in
trouble we have remarkable debt build up
we have a demographic curve we're
getting old very
fast and along with a number of things
we have to do we have to get
dramatically more efficient and we have
to cut down cost
externalities that's where AI became
fascinating to us is everything from the
the diagnostic side in
healthcare to actually changing and
removing much of the
bureaucracy that is access to health to
government itself um and so within those
sort of protocols it's shocking the push
back you receive from both the
fearmongers but also those that will
use um legitimate concerns as ways of
barriers to policy changes that would
allow the adoption of
AI and that was one of the reasons I was
actually um pleased to be get to spend
some time with you is I think it's it's
appropriate that we also talk about the
societal benefits of doing this
well I agree uh David you brought up
some uh incredible points so I'm going
to just first ask you a little bit uh
about blockchain because you're the I
think the co-chair of the blockchain
caucus how do you view the intersection
of AI and blockchain Technology
especially given regulatory challenges
and opportunities can you tell our
audience a little bit about that um
actually um even with a couple of my
friends who are much smarter than I will
ever dream to be um looking at the
ability to particularly um using
blockchain as ways to you know
absolutely document
ownership and you know the classic um
blockchain of even now some of the ways
of split your data sets so it you know
the the level of encryption so if
Tomorrow there's Quantum you know we
actually still you your passwords are
protected those sorts of things there's
ways to do that so even a really
Advanced AI crawler can't collect all
those things so there are ways where I
actually think um a well-designed
Distributive Ledger um and and the most
modern designs actually coexists in a
way of AI so AI scrubs the world gathers
information hopefully then ranks the
quality of that information so we can
make do decision making and over here if
if that helped us do
health and over here I need to protect
your privacy of how AI is now helping um
manage your health and and and look for
um
abnormalities but you want your privacy
I actually see have a design in my head
where they actually work quite well with
each
other so if I can just follow up on
another topic which you're very
passionate about is deep fakes and you
talked a lot about that and we going
talk a little bit about that do you
think blockchain might have an ability
to authenticate stuff uh unlike
watermarking uh can you tell our
audience your thoughts on that the
answer is yes and that one's a fairly
obvious use case and I have no idea how
I get it broadly
implemented it it's so the the use case
is
obvious um so I want to take a a
brilliant guy who does a podcast on
Ai and I want to take you know what he's
done and change
it now we could lock you down saying hey
you you got to have this tag or this
certificate coming from our distributive
Ledger um our blockchain auth
authentication but that doesn't stop a
spoof from putting it out on other
platforms other directions and so it
it's brilliant for financial
transactions it's brilliant for certain
levels of
authentication um my bigger concern is
the
industrialization of
Fraud and this is sort of not where I
thought we would go but it's actually
really important um we're looking at at
at even commercial articles about how
much
misinformation is now produced by
Machine coming pouring in from Bad
actors around the world even potenti
actors who just want to spoof a
stock or other Financial transactions or
engage in massive um where you know you
get the text message saying this is the
IRS but the scramble and some of the
things behind it are actually you know a
a downloaded AI app yep I don't think
Society is completely
ready for a natural language um
voicemail you get that sounds like your
grandma or a video like this where
someone has taken our language and
changed
us and and and I see chaos coming in
society um we already see some of the
things happening in parts of like the
Indian elections that are coming you
know a billion people voting and they're
already having a war of fake videos
circulating in the country imagine that
being all around the world this year
where so many people in republics are
voting and we're going to have to first
thing build a more skeptical
audience um just because you see
something in this format doesn't
necessarily mean it's real that's true
that's true uh a lot of Elections lot of
democracies at stake
um is there a danger when audience
becomes too skeptical also
David everybody people think everything
is fake
actually in a weird way I'd rather have
that
bias because eventually we all crave
information and there's a couple
brilliant articles out there um if
anyone's a really more academic minded
um uh one article I think it uh it's
researchers um the need for chaos some
of these other things that that there
there academic articles are talking
about um human nature wanting the status
of the first person to send something or
being the first person to tell your
friends on social media or those things
even when that person knows it's
probably fake you know it's probably
artificial photo those things heaven
knows you know on this silly thing I
have here I get Insanity all day long
Often by very well educated people and
when you pick up the phone and call them
and they say oh yeah I knew it wasn't
real or probably wasn't real but I
thought it was interesting
what happens when we're we're seeking
status and
recognition but the way we're doing it
is information
pollution and so the reality a high
level of skepticism might actually be
better for
society where okay I got this but now
I'm gonna go to Credible Publications
I'm going to go look at The Economist
magazine or Barons or Wall Street
Journal or these sorts of things and see
if I can find vetting of it
um I think that would be healthier than
believing everything it comes
in so skepticism is good um David
shifting a little bit to healthcare
which is also a big passion and you are
really a Pioneer you proposed the
healthy technology act which aims to
qualify Ai and machine learning as
eligible to prescribe drugs can you
elaborate for our audience the rational
behind this bill and and this one's
actually very important and if you have
any um really smart people out there
listening to this I need their help um
first off let let's lay the ground rules
last week we had multiple days where we
went over borrowing $100,000 a
second and the economy is actually
pretty
healthy structurally most folks do not
have their heads around the
demographic crisis United States is
almost fa is facing in 15 years we have
more deaths than
births today the growth of debt is
interest and health care costs it's not
everything else even though the other
things are what we talk about because
that raises money gets us on television
but it's interest in health care costs
so unless you have a revolution in the
cost of providing Health Services of
making our brothers and sisters
healthier um I don't know how we're
going to finance it it really does
consume everything in its path
um everything a member of Congress now
votes on is
borrowed um to just give you a sense of
the scale we're at so if I came to you
tomorrow and said hey here's let's just
use this example because it's a real
example there's this thing it looks like
a ginormous
kazoo you could blow into it and within
minute or so it would tell you whether
you have a certain category of virus or
bacteria in your system it could bounce
off your medical records and then order
your antiviral knowing you're not
allergic to that particular
antiviral that type of
Technology exists but it's not
reimbursable many state legislatures um
would make that illegal it is
functionally illegal but that would be
an algorithm
prescribing would that make you and I
healthier would cut down some of the
timelines where you know I look at me I
have two very young children uh my wife
and are at the same age the ability to
take a day off work try to get an
appointment with the pediatrition those
things instead what would happen if you
can have that breath biopsy in your home
medicine cabinet but it's not enough to
have the data if it can't ultimately
prescribe the other benefits are also
you know we constantly get barraged of
the shortage of healthc Care
Professionals this is actually you know
at a base level help deal with that and
it's
shocking the push back you get but this
is the same sort of push back we got
over tella Health remember for a couple
years tellah Health was one of the most
lobbied against um Technologies things
in Washington DC before the pandemic
because it changed business
models and that's the the sort of
disruption you and I must bring if we're
going to both deal with making our
brothers and sisters healthier but also
dealing with this stunning growth of the
debt so a couple of points I want our
audience to know that you are actually a
Pioneer on tele Health you were talking
about it before covid Oh yeah and you in
many cases have been ahead of your time
it's oh yeah I used to get the crap
kicked out of me for it so I think
aren't you like the co-chair of that cus
too tell Health cus yeah who knows I may
have founded it but you may have founded
it so but what was fascinating is many
of those who were opposing the
legislation they didn't actually oppose
the technology what they would come and
say look we're the Real Estate Investors
who bought the land under the Urgent
Care Centers we calculate that we would
lose a third of our walk-ins if they
could just hit FaceTime on their phone
talk to an avatar and get a quick
diagnosis of what's wrong it became
about the
money and and and I encourage folks
that's not evil or this that it's just
it's it's the way the economics in our
society work but those of us who see you
know there's a reason you didn't go to
Blockbuster Video last weekend the
technology around us
changes and change has actually been
really good for this Society at least
from a way we live um I just need more
members of Congress to stop being
terrified of the army of lobbyists in
their hallway
so um David just to follow up on this
whole algorithm because I find it very
fascinating as you said we need a
solution on healthc care and we need
access in rural areas in inner cities
Etc which is something you're talking
about tele Health gave everybody equal
access to at least tried to give
everybody equal access but in algorithms
don't you think your colleagues are
going to talk about privacy and those
kinds of issues that come up yeah it
anyone talks about privacy um isn't very
technical the fact of the matter is you
and I can make someone's privacy on
tella Health we can lock it down already
the fact of the matter is you're
probably getting a text message this
week from your Pharmacy telling you your
drugs are ready that's not meeting the
the levels of security that you could
have by an encryption and chain and an
app um it privacy's easy and about six
seven years ago we were part of you know
with um a couple very technical agencies
we won't name them all writing a white
paper that said if you use these
encryption standards it's bulletproof
you know at least in today's world until
there's Quantum you're safe you can just
unlay these so if you wear um a
smartwatch or willing to do the Dexcom
you know which will be available later
the summer for without prescription to
manage your blood glucose or or the ring
or some of these things you functionally
have attached a medical lab to your
body as that world gets even better
should it be allowed to help you manage
your health should you be in charge of
your own
health and a lot of the folks who oppose
this technology disruption will throw up
oh what about privacy what about this
what about that um that's the easy the
Privacy is the easy one to cover um
reimbursement in some of the
politics um at the state level and
federal level are actually much
trickier um shifting to another topic
you introduced the audit act to
streamline the department of defense's
audit process bless you yeah so can you
explain to our audience who don't know
about the billion dollars that's going
down okay uh so this is you s you'll
love this one because it's such an easy
thought experiment
um the Pentagon I think just had its
eighth audit report from the GAO saying
it's unauditable it is impossible to
audit the Pentagon and this has now gone
on for most of a decade where they come
back and say we don't know their asset
list we can't do this um came across an
article um several months ago about a
handful a couple of the
big um International auditing firm
saying experimenting with AI aits that
are able to crawl over inventory lists
asset lists appreciation models
everything else and crawl up and down
those datas and build it okay if this
exists you've already been told the
Pentagon is UN auditable why wouldn't
you just do let's let unleash AI let's
have an AI package audit the Pentagon
matter of fact I and I do this because
it's easy to understand now my personal
passion is to do this type of Technology
up and down all of
government over durable medical
equipment because we keep knowing
there's billions and billions of fraud
there on all these sorts of things the
fact the matter is you could do instead
of a a traditional AI stack it's
actually more of an AI crawler to go
over these data sets in a living
crowdsourced fashion where every day
it's it's working its way through you
know new data sets and finding things I
even have a model where this works
environmental data where it's almost
living crowdsourced so you don't need
today's um model where you fill up
paperwork you stick it in a file cabinet
and several years later you sue someone
over what's in the file cabinet but
you're living collecting constant
crowdsource data so if there's a bad
actor making a mistake out there you
catch them
immediately but I use the audit the
Pentagon AI as because it's so simple to
understand um sometimes when I go off in
these other things I get glassy eyed
looks back right uh just to finish that
point can you tell our audience the
scale of the problem uh with
Pentagon stunning think of going most of
a decade with the audit report that
comes back saying we can't audit it you
know you should have a a document like
this and in said we get one sheet it
says no can't be done we tried we put
the Auditors out there we looked at all
the data sets we can't figure
out that should enrage people because in
a weird way think of the fragility you
create to even the security state do we
have enough weapons do we have enough
inventory do we have enough parts do we
have enough this do we have enough that
do we have too much of this do we have
things we actually don't
know and yet the push back has been
fascinating it's almost like some of the
um bureaucracy likes us not knowing wow
isn't that scary our tax dollars work oh
my god um changing topics to another
area of your passion uh David tribal
policy is an area where you demonstrated
significant leadership how do you see AI
impacting indigenous communities and
what steps do you think we can take to
make sure there's Equitable access and
participation to them it's brilliant
question and and I I thank you because I
almost never get this one um can I give
sort of a a in a use case and we'll work
back with that because it makes it
easier to understand um I'm blessed I
live in Arizona trust me if you could
see what's outside my window here you'd
be moving here
um uh I actually have some uh longtime
friends um Navajo Nation part of their
family is out in a Chapter House in the
middle of
nowhere um they've been waiting almost a
DEC deade for a piece of copper or Fiber
to get to them so they could have
broadband that's inmoral what we've done
is we created this rural Broadband yet
somehow it never gets to them tomorrow
you and I could do this we could go out
there we could put up a small satellite
dish put up some re Wi-Fi repeaters to
next day we have Broadband then the next
day after that you could actually engage
in a type of indigenously respectful
tella health you could actually do
wearables for those that might be have
diabetes or other things to be able to
help manage their their health
statistics it's it so many people think
of healthcare as oh once a year I go
visit a doctor or I get a cough I make
an appointment and five days later I'm
able to get into you know the the visit
the medical professional and what I'm
trying to argue particularly for
isolated populations and this could even
be in urban
areas Healthcare could be 24 hours a day
7 days a week because the technology we
have that could read off your
body and the ability to look for things
that are abnormal or things you're doing
well and it's not that complex this none
of this is Cutting Edge some of this
this technology you and I are talking
about right now is a decade out of date
already it just is uncomfortable because
many people built business models on the
old sort of make an appointment walk-in
model so
um do you think either personalized
medicine or personalized
education can play a role with some of
those communities uh who don't get
because every everybody is different and
AI has that ability uh David to doing
that and you know education also is very
important for some of those indigenous
communities youal about the Nao Nation
I've had a lot of experience in working
with them
education access to education also
becomes an important aspect for them
brilliant um and also think of some of
our isolated
populations um you know uh have a Supai
you're in functioning the bottom of the
Grand Canyon y um they have a small
school there that's run by um the Bureau
of Indian Affairs um getting a teacher
to stay down there is tough
okay but they do have a satellite dish
why couldn't they have some of the best
teachers in
America at just this afternoon you have
your science class from someone that's
at the masonian tomorrow you have
English with a grad student from Yale
that's the fact matter is
rethinking and yet you will get this
push back saying no no we need people
sitting in the room
well that's actually sort of cruel when
you don't understand some of the
populations we have around this country
it's both my um Na Native American
populations to even some rural
populations to even young people or even
those of us who are older who want to
learn skill sets and have access to what
we're talking on right
now um and and it's more than just
education it's the ability to pursue
Joys and interest and the ability to
become part of the community
using technology it doesn't have to be
this dystopian isolator in many ways if
we can get rid of the scam artists who
are often on these types of platforms um
it could actually work we just it's like
the forgive me for doing a slight
nonsecretor but see if I can make this
make sense um a decade and a half ago a
friend of mine were elated when we
started to see the proliferation of
blogs because we thought we were going
to get the expert on this would start
writing a Blog and we're interested in
that and what we found was it wasn't the
expert it was often a
propagandist who was writing that blog
not the
expert so back to our earlier finding a
bit of
skepticism and so a way to say this
person truly has the degree the PHD
they're a master welder and they're
going to teach you how to
weld um you know on a video or on a
YouTube those things could help
Americans help
productivity and make it so you can
learn skills without the cost of a piece
of real estate and air conditioning and
all those other things I I it's the
education now is in the palm of your
hand a and and we need to promote more
of that um I think that's what helps us
break
through David one of the teams that I
hear and I have a few important question
but is you're very concerned and as
rightfully as you said it was $100,000 a
second of debt right uh that we were
incurring and Healthcare is what about
20% of our GDP and then you identified
the demographic issue that we are facing
in terms of more deaths than
births do you believe AI in some shape
or form with its ability in healthc care
and I've had some top-notch experts on
the show who are talking about how it
will reduce the amount of time it takes
10 years to come up with a drug and this
is going to shorten the space but also
reduce it takes a billion dollars to
come up with a a proper drug so it's
going to shorten the space it's timeline
Etc do you think this is our way out of
the so to speak mess we are in it's it's
part of the formula um I believe a few
weeks ago we had the first AI designed
drug yep um I've met with the folks who
have designed um crawlers that are
looking at um uh phological formulas
that already exist today and looking at
their alternative use
cases
um we don't have a
choice a and and there becomes part
of you know the the aspect of there's
ways to do this
and um what happens if if even in in a
drug trial I could actually design my
population statistics and use data now
some of that's not necessarily AI it's
it's AI like in in in in saying here's
my population I can I can build a
formula so one of the things we're
working on is what can we do with the
FDA so when you get certain positive
phase two that your next layer we can
actually use a lot of data to fill in
your population statistics and right
there you could cut sometimes years
often bring new disruption or new cures
to Market so it's not only the discovery
of new compounds um you also even now
see it in
genetics um you know we just had our
first true genetic cure in CLE cell
anemia um approved and that's coming to
the market um we've been working with a
number of folks trying to actually cure
diabetes which is much more complex but
there's incredible hope there um even
down to when you have a new formulary
how do you get it the morality of
bringing it to the populations that are
suffering sooner so that's a really
FASTT talking way to say yeah you're
right on Mark this could be very
hopeful how do we break down the
barriers and how do I get fellow policy
makers to actually see the optimism
instead of always the fear I've had a
lot of your colleagues on this show one
of the concerns that they talk about one
of the many is AI is moving so rapidly
you know just every day there's
something new they're saying how does
regulation or how do they keep up or how
do does regulation keep up with this
technology any advice for some of your
colleagues on this topic yeah we've
actually have a living example on this
um when we started I I said you know two
of my weird interests in life are you
know AI but maybe even more synthetic
biology and you go
huh but we built protocols 20 years ago
with a concept saying if you're doing
certain types of things and this has
become much more true in the last three
years certain types of things it needs
to be walled off you basically build an
isolation box there's certain types of
AI design
that you know can overwrite code do this
do that before you unleash those into
the wild they should be done in
isolation you could actually look to
sort of the policy and Rule sets that
already
exist and those playing with genomes and
those things and sort of take that same
sort of rule set and say for this type
of code for these types of
stacks um and other types of AI here's
the rule set
and here's so that way instead of trying
to regulate down to the individual
project you actually have a regulation
that's sort of principles
based um so the
IRS sets up chat GPT or a version of
chat and you call in and say I need help
on this form and the person you're
talking to stays on the phone with you
for half an hour helps you fill out your
form and it turns out it's a computer MH
that probably doesn't need levels of
Regulation um that's not going to be
malicious the one that may be trying to
find a way to overwrite you know code on
every security camera in America that
probably does need um a way to find it
attack it and even you know the debate
I've had with some people on bias in AI
code the fact of the matter is the
beauty of code is I can audit the bias I
can't audit people's hearts and
minds and I've actually been presented
an AI that looks for
bias so it's an AI auditing AI so if you
just if you whiteboard some of these
things there are solutions just some of
the solutions are hard some of the
solutions are hard uh one of the points
that has been brought up and I know
you've been an on entrepreneur is the
concern that AI could become in the get
in the hands of a few large tech
companies like the social media that we
have in you know it's very expensive to
build a large language model as you know
it takes a billion dollars or whatever
it is uh your thoughts you've been on
the other side too as an entrepreneur uh
we want to keep the Innovation going
that's what our country is and we just
talked about the amazing things it can
do but we also want to somehow balance
it what are your thoughts on that David
another really good question uh I have
faith in the markets I do have intense
concern that the US economy is becoming
a series of
oligopolies um and with that becomes the
stifling of creativity and Innovation
but we also see the crashing of
price um think about the a AI power
today compared to just 12 months
ago um even the subscriptions you can
get today and the things you can code to
those subscriptions that are available
today compared to a year ago so today
you can be an entrepreneur who says
we're going to build um back Office
billing for surgery centers and we're
going to use AI to look at it and do the
clean claims billing today you could
build that and you just subscribe to
someone who has that billion do Ai and
just run it off their system if the
business models continue with the the
couple Giants out
there where they're providing sort of
the toolkit and then the creative
entrepreneurs build off of that I think
that's disruptive and the price will
continue to come
down that's as long as they don't try to
then control those entrepreneurial
business models and I would argue we
already have
um trade rules for that um you just have
to have a justice department that's
willing to enforce
them so we do have rules that uh as you
said that can be
enforced just taking that forward um
what are your thoughts of Open Source
versus closed Source uh David you know
there's two camps uh you have the
Microsoft open AI which is closed Source
uh you have you know some others like
meta has has got llama and mistol and
others now for just for people to know
open source where people can access code
build on that now obviously the close
Source people say here our enemies can
get their hands on it with their weights
and stuff but you you dealt with
blockchain and everything else so I want
to hear from you what what what are your
thoughts on that it's something I
haven't given a lot of thought you know
I used to play with lenx you know where
I had part my open source um you know I
mean I I'm in my home right now I have a
series of raspberry pies around the
house that that run my Gates that that
um I us a public type of python to do
the in and
outs I actually like the idea of the
entire mix competing with each
other
um but even even the open source
eventually you hit a certain product
draw use level where they're going to
need some cash flow saying all right I
now need to use this much of your
product I coded to it now I'll pay you
my you know you know fee per use or fee
per
month
um as long as the world hasn't become
all closed all subscription base you
know I'm actually sort of enthusiastic
to see I want to see the chaos of
talent um with lots of optionality
because the reality you you may come up
with something that's a use case that
you don't need a supercomputer behind it
you know you just need it's this
specialty these these sets of data what
I'm more concerned about compared to the
closed and open is access to Quality
data for the decision-making itself
particularly in healthcare um you do
find there's some amazing data sets out
there and some of those who hold it are
jealously guarding it
um keeping it from becoming available to
even to the researchers sometimes even
to
government and that we have to fix
because there's lots of way to strip you
know with those that say privacy it's
really easy to strip any identifying
characteristics and some of those
population statistics May mean life or
death to people in the future with
curatives um so I I I would argue
there's a moral argument for access to
data for researchers those who are
coming up with the next best cure yeah
so data is obviously uh a big big
challenge because large uh AI companies
are running out of uh data to harvest so
to speak um David the EU has come up
with the EU AI act uh we are still
working through it we have a
presidential year it's going to be hard
how important do you believe is it for
international cooperation or
harmonization because if you're a global
company if you have to deal with a state
legislation I mean you worked in the
State uh also with the state legislation
of federal one or different one in EU a
different one in
China any thoughts on International
collaboration on this this is where I
have my highest degree of
stress
um because theyve been I've been shocked
at some of the reports we've ground
through where some other countries the
amount of their resources that are going
in to AI but not for good um almost
malign whether it be their money is AI
for weaponry and
propaganda instead of health care or
efficiency or fixing traffic issues or
all the other good use
cases um
and I fear you may see a world where it
become um you know Western nations with
certain common principles building a
co-op
compact of here's the rule sets here's
how we use it um and some of the dodgy
actors we may have to find a way to
identify when it's their code that's
crawling and that's hard
um you know particularly you know we've
already had you've already seen some of
the stories of things we found in
firmware and other things that that talk
to others
and and we almost are going to have to
build sort of hard lines saying you
know yeah yeah even to some of the more
totalitarian
countries
um do they isolate themselves and then
produce
meant um things and try to put it out in
in the common for the west and I'm not
brilliant enough to know completely how
to do this um I I've read there's a
couple papers out there of Redline this
Redline that but if you really dig into
it I don't think they
work um so are you going to now have to
design an AI that looks for malicious
Ai and oddly enough that's been the best
solution I've had someone come up with
wow so yeah looking for m
AI um David uh there have been all kinds
of reports uh about the transformative
power of AI on jobs McKenzie IMF there
are all kinds of numbers 60% 40% 30% but
the consensus is there's a major
transformation happening in especially
in certain areas customer service coding
uh etc etc law content management
marketing um
what are your thoughts I mean and is
there a role for the government uh
in preparing the population or doing
something about it there both is and in
other examples of um you know we we've
seen some of this in in trade disruption
and those things and the reality the
bureaucracy in some ways well intended
made things almost worse um I joked
about it earlier but you we've lived a
version of this um you're obviously not
old enough but we used to have these
things called Blockbuster video where
you went and got your little silver disc
and then you know it felt like overnight
but over you know a couple years we went
home and hit a button and now we
streamed our media there were tens of
thousands of workers there there were
thousands and thousands and thousands of
you know retail space that were now
emptied and closed now picture that sort
of disrupt in multiples but the fact of
the matter is you have a society where
we don't actually have enough
workers you actually have a society
where demographically we're getting old
very fast we're in desperate need to
raise productivity to increase living
standards but also to create the capital
um velocity so we have some ability to
stabilize our US debt and my fear is if
you get the sort of um
um the
trogdon the damage from that will be
much greater than some of the
displacement which I think is going to
happen in number of White Collar yeah um
but at the same time every time we
thought you know this huge you know this
this this argument's been going back
time in Memorial whether it be the
Industrial Age or you know the computer
age or some of these other things
there's always the world's coming to end
we're going to have job
displacements but healthy market
economies always have this rotation now
it feels like crap when you're the one
being
rotated but that's also how you build a
a healthier Better Living standard in a
society is you're constantly rotating to
what's most
productive um yes there's going to be
displacement if it's overwhelming yes
there's a place for government but
government has be very
careful you you it doesn't slow down the
transition of the next best economic
driver so not slow down the economic
driver there will be displacement but
it'll be rotation and hopefully lead to
more Prosperity um there and I can
almost give you an ex there's a couple
studies done
preo that looked at job training
programs and what we found in the data
sets and this these studies and these
were University type of academic studies
that job training for the next
generation was and this always
angers you know some of the world of
Academia was much more effective when
sponsored and done at the employer
level than often at my academic
institution level Because by the time
the academic institution level built its
program got it certified got
accreditation those
things the private sector had already
moved on to the next
technology so do you do things in the
tax code regulatory code those that make
it so the employer is constantly
investing in the new best piece of
equipment and constantly bringing on its
people to be able to benefit both in
higher wages but also be higher
productivity for Society at the employer
level and um for some of the control
free I I work with they see a government
sort of solution and I would argue it's
an incentive solution at the employer
level so it's more at the employer level
um David uh finally what advice would
you give to policy makers and
legislators around the world who are
grappling with the challenge of you know
AI how to regulate it Etc you have
incredible experience I mean like I said
I I have two hours worth more more of
questions but I won't bring you back but
uh some uh words of wisdom to our
audience to the lawmakers we have a lot
of lawmakers in EU listening to you too
um a couple things one consume stunning
amounts of coffee and read a
lot um one of the things I found hardest
in my
job is finding that time for
intellectual Capital to just force
yourself to read and read and read and
then read some
more um the world is moving very quickly
around us and if you're going to be in
the policymaking business make sure you
understand this generation the next
Generations of policy decisions because
so much what we debate in Congress is
already a decade two decades out of date
and I'm I'm being very sincere on this
we do great damage to ourselves our
society our governments our populations
when we're not paying attention to what
what don't think you know what's coming
to tomorrow you got to always design
things so there's lots of what they call
optionality don't be so arrogant that
you and I think we know what tomorrow's
technology is going to bring because
there's going to be a breakthrough
that's going to surprise us design
policy that allows the disruption allows
the
creativity and maybe move away from what
we everything we thought we knew from a
previous decade um because much of that
is now quite outdated and it's also one
of the problems we have in Regulatory
and tax codes um they they just are not
keeping up with how quickly technology
and Society is moving wow some great
Insight have a lot of coffee read a lot
read read and read and read and go where
the puck is going to be not where the
puck is way gr Wayne grety the great
used to say the secret of his success I
think that is a fantastic uh advice uh
thank you David really for sharing such
uh amazing insights uh on AI regulation
and the implications of AI for our
society really to our listeners you know
uh this has been an amazing amazing
interaction and you provided us a road
map for navigating the complexities of
the AI landscape and to our listeners
thank you for staying tuned and for
engaging in discussions and Ai and
regulation until next time this is
Sanjay Puri again thank you David thanks
so much for being with us thank you for
having me
