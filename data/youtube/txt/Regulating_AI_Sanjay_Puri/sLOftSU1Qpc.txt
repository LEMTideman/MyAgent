responsible AIS with Microsoft and IBM
and the United Nations FAO and I think
the Vatican as well being able to come
together for the Rome call for ethics
and so I tried to bring that kind of uh
by learning by doing see how to do
digital Health ecosystems at the
national local but also Global level as
well do you think the way medicine is
now being taught uh needs to change
given uh what technology is there

how to responsibly tackle ai's
challenges while fostering Innovation
and
[Music]
balance welcome to another episode of
regulating AI where we delve into the
complexities of creating fair and
Equitable regulations for artificial
intelligence our podcast features
insights from various perspectives from
industry leaders and government
officials to advocacy groups together
they address pivotal questions that are
needed to create fair and practical
legislation I'm your host Sanjay Puri
and today we have the honor of speaking
with Dr Dominique monzon a Trailblazer
in the field of AI ethics and data
science Dr Monon is the world's first
triple doctorate trained physician data
scientist and AI ethicist with a
remarkable background in leveraging AI
to address pressing health challenges
and inequities from his groundbreaking
work in cardio oncology to his
contributions to the field of poverty
alleviation through personalized
medicine and public health his expertise
spans across disciplines making him a
leading figure in shaping the ethical
and Regulatory Frameworks surrounding AI
join us as we explore his insights into
the intersection of AI Health Equity and
Global policy welcome Dominic thank you
for having me great uh Dominic our show
uh has a global audience uh we have uh
members of congress senate their staff
we have industry leaders we have
advocacy groups and as I said it's
really a global audience North America
Europe Asia uh South America so having
said that can you share uh with our
audience about your journey that led you
to become this triple doctorate trained
physician data scientist and
aist yes sir and again I I appreciate
the kind invitation to join you and your
influential audience because we
desperately need you because I came from
a small little two and a half red light
town in a poor rural forming community
over in southwest of the US and so I
grew up in my mom's Clinic she had
unfortunately on the first day she began
as a nurse went to go take her St State
nursing board exam doing breakfast with
Grandpa and she unfortunately clutch his
chest fell to the ground and because
we're in a for forming town There's No
Doctor coming there's no ambulance right
around the corner so Mom jumped on
started doing the chest compressions
trying to bring him back to life re part
the part that unfortunately had failed
and unfortunately 15 becomes 20 becomes
30 minutes and then by the time the
ambulance finally arrived unfortunately
they confirmed that he had already gone
so Mom goes on takes that state exam
just a few hours later scores one of the
only perfect scores in the exam's
history and then over the next 20 years
became a nurse practitioner doctor to
nurse practice opened up the clinic just
100 yards facing the front door of
Grandpa's house and she just did what we
weren't able to for him namely providing
care for an underserved community and so
I grew up in that clinic and I just
wanted to follow mom's lead be able to
give back to the community that raised
me but with all the changes in
healthcare it became increasingly clear
that medicine had to change to keep up
and so I had started medical school to
try to follow mom's lead and just care
for the community but quickly realized
that the changes required a different
additional approach and so that's where
I began the first PhD in the AI side of
Health managements with a policy and
Global Management standpoint and then
that was just a way to keep mom's Clinic
open and so using smart AI to allow good
people and good communities to get good
care for those who need it most and then
that accidentally translated into
working with the United Nations because
a lot of the technical side led into a
lot of the ethical side especially when
we try to scale Innovations from the AI
standpoint and so is a AI responsible is
it transparent is it safe it's something
the community wants and can lead and so
that accidentally led me into the second
PhD in the ethics side of that and so I
presented this work ultimately with
microsofts over in Rome backr February
2020 I believe when they were convening
the as I understand the first highlevel
multi- sector consensus on responsible
AIS with Microsoft and IBM and the
United Nations FAO and I think the
Vatican as well being able to come
together for the Rome call for ethics
and so I was surprised a little guy from
a two red light farming town was asked
to give his presentation on how to do
this kind of integrated work so I was
awarded surprisingly the world's as I
understand top doctoral dissertation on
AI ethics trying to propose how do you
take the mathematics bring it together
with the medicine bring it together with
the ethics to ultimately allow
communities everywhere to be able to
help like I try to do in my little area
take care of their community
well uh Dominic uh listening to you I
definitely feel uh absolute
underachiever you've done things that
people take multiple lifetimes uh so
firstly congratulations on that and
really heartwarming to hear uh about
your growing up in that small town and
you know it really gives hope uh to a
lot of those small towns and I think
when we talk about AI how it is going to
revolutionize the availability and
access and remove the Health uh equities
but just one quick point because I've
had this discussions with uh leaders of
uh medical schools and uh programs on
this
show do you think the way medicine is
now being taught uh needs to change
given uh what technology is there
shouldn't the curriculum and I brought
this up and uh they said that there is a
big discussion going on but you are the
epitome of what the of the new phys
should be like but then you you are an
exception but that should not be the
case
right excellent points in terms of
should education keep up with patient
needs I definitely agree with you and
that's where we're seeing a lot of
Promise so for instance when I had
started medical school it was shortly
after Hurricane Katrina had decimated
New Orleans and we had just
unfortunately hundreds and we think
thousands
of deaths there particularly in the
lower income racial minority communities
good people that just couldn't afford to
get out and so when you have these food
deserts and these large expanses of the
city that just didn't have access to
healthy foods they didn't have access to
Affordable doctors and so I worked with
a team as I was working on Mom's Clinic
back home I was also trying to figure
out how to use AI to bring the best of
medicine the best public health the best
of AI and the best of Education together
so we were very fortunate to
accidentally as we look back co-found
that culinary medicine movement where we
sorted in a an abandoned grocery store
and we brought together a school brought
together our Medical School a local high
school a local grocery store and a bunch
of community organizations where the
community itself led the way and they
said we need this and but we want to
make sure we don't get lost in the
conversation with a bunch of big powers
that come in and swoop in and do it
their own way so we tried it at the
table together quite literally the
dinner table in our little fledging
teaching kitchen ask the community what
do you want and then they told us here's
what's important to us and we said this
is what we think we can bring together
how can we do it together and so I tried
to bring that kind of uh by learning by
doing approach where I would bring in
other medical students and then nursing
students medical trainees and even
eventually attending physicians to be
able to eventually develop and try to
fin tune this model of learning by doing
the way that medical education can adapt
in real time where you don't just sit in
a CL classroom and get lectured about
organs you actually talk to people who
organs are failing at the dinner table
together so it was teaching the medical
students and the medical trainees and
attendings how to cook how to talk
nutrition how to talk it in a way that's
relevance affordable and impactful for
these communities who most need this and
then we were able to then show through a
series of randomized control trials that
I developed and a long-term cohort or a
long-term study on this all driven by
the AI to help us understand and time
what works and what doesn't work and to
change quite literally the curriculum in
real time to fix it we were able to
improve Patients health improve their
food savings per week at the grocery
store and ultimately improve the
competencies of the trainees and the
attending physicians in how to do this
work well and what we found very
exciting is that we could find that not
only can we improve medical education as
a supplement not a replacement to what's
happening in the lecture halls and
happening in the hospitals we were able
to show that Physicians and to be
Physicians were much more engaged they
wanted to not just do this work they
wanted to keep improving the medical
education themselves so they could see
in real time that they can impact this
whole process this whole life cycle of
medical education Innovation not just
research and clinical care and then we
were able to then scale that to I
believe Now 50 plus medical schools
throughout the country and we have now
some that are outside the US as well and
it's very exciting to watch this work
continue so in brief to your to your
question yes I definitely agree that not
only is it possible not only is it
doable but people want this both the
patients the providers and the trainees
and we're seeing in conclusion that this
is worked that increasingly spreading
overseas if I can mention one last
little part to your excellent question
so I also am a professor of bioethics
for a couple of United Nation
universities including in Mexico and so
I teach graduate students on uh really
from four continents particularly Asia
Africa South America Eastern Europe and
what we're seeing is a lot lot of
Physicians a lot of Public Health
researchers a lot of healthcare
administrators lawyers um just Hospital
staff want to do this work but
unfortunately we're seeing that there's
a an ivory Tower syndrome still in the
global North particularly in the US and
Europe we have this Legacy hold over
where we've got the intellectual
property we've got the exciting Tech
we've got the exciting curriculum models
coming out but it's not inclusive enough
and therefore Innovative and adaptive
enough to meet the needs of the global
patient population not just our local
communities so what we're finding out is
that through my own little work trying
to be able to learn from The Graduate
students I teach these Physicians and
lawyers administrators but to try to be
able to provide and propose to them what
we found that works and then learn in
real time from them so it's not a
unilateral but it's a bilateral medical
education Innovation that's happening at
a global level at scale and with
relevant impact on local communities so
I'm very excited about what we're seeing
coming out with this these Global
Partnerships so uh you talked about
global Partnerships and Community
involvement just one last question
before uh I
move there is a generational divide uh
which is obviously relevant you know you
have Physicians who've been trained who
have uh maybe you know who grew up pre-
internet uh era so to speak um and then
you have these new well we are looking
at one um but now the jour ation uh of
Physicians that is coming in is uh
talking about whether it's the tools of
AI the ethics the equity of is that
currently in the course curriculum for
them is that being taught uh currently
Dominic that was the question which I
asked them and they said they are uh the
powers that we are looking at tweaking
uh the course curriculum do you think
that should be done uh Dominic yes sir
because ultimately Medical educ
should be about patient care we should
be training people who care and know how
to care for their local community based
upon where their needs are and so if
we're not achieving the outcomes we need
we need to change the process by which
we're getting those outcomes and so we
see that patients increasingly now more
than ever in human history plugged into
the global digital ecosystem and just
what the last 48 months we have a
doubling of smartphone users on the
planet with some of the fastest uptick
in Subara Africa and Southeast Asia
India for instance is a real Pioneer in
this being able to as you probably know
well see how to do digital Health
ecosystems at the national local but
also Global level as well not only
because is it are we learning from
people on all sides of the planets as
one Innovation Works in one area we can
scale it globally but also we're seeing
that we need each other to be able to
improve this for Mutual benefit and so
to your point unfortunately there is a
lag though between where patients are
and where Medical education is and so
though we are seeing promising work done
and my hats off of course to all the the
industrious and intrepids medical school
pioneers and Educators and leaders who
doing this difficult work of trying to
translate on one hands the best of
evidence-based medicine we can and best
of evidence-based medical education
including with the aips into real-time
medical education that challenges
understandably there's been a historic I
think we can say caution and I think
rightly so in healthcare just because it
works in other sectors we're cautious we
want to make sure we don't mess it up
when we translate into patients lives
because if we make errors and scale
those errors then we're hurting people
in real time it's not simply though it's
important it's not simply getting a
business model wrong it's getting
someone's life wrong so though I I
respect those concerns at the same time
there are ways which we found that
increasingly you can scale medical
education in real time effectively
responsive to local community needs and
local community identity but at the same
time learning from the global ecosystem
in this regard so we are seeing in brief
to your question promising pioneering
projects but no clear long-term
sustainable evidence-based standardized
approach to doing this work and that's
where for instance with my little work
in culinary medicine and incre
increasingly with my work in the
bioethics and the AI ethics and the
cardio oncology worlds we're trying to
be able to find areas that are
clinically relevant for patient
populations and provide that as
addendums to supplement and enhance
existing curriculum so that way medical
schools have the autonomy and the agency
to say we want this we don't want that
but by picking up these kind of in a
sense modular new things they're able to
take with it the entire educational
model that education life cycle of
innovation where people have the
students not just the attendant and the
patient patient communities that are
innovating Real Time how to adjust the
curriculum and therefore you're able to
maintain safety and control on the
curriculum but at the same time
responsiveness to the needs of the
patients so we are seeing promise in
that as a compromise a halfway position
getting medical education where it is
now and to where it needs to be shortly
hopefully I'm hoping uh some of the
decision makers do listen to this and
they'll be listening to your uh message
uh Dominic uh shifting to uh uh ethics
what are some key ethical consideration
in your view uh that should go into
integrating are into Healthcare
practices that's a tough one and so I
wrote uh four books now and counting on
that so I'll try to give the condensed
version the short answer is I think that
globally there is a common understanding
of what good care looks like and what
good Tech enabled care looks like that's
responsive to the needs of the patients
that's safe that is effective that's
transparent we understand how it was
made we understand how it rolls out we
understand who benefits from it not just
the people the patient at bedside or
communities are in the hospital or the
clinics but also the providers doing
that but also all the tech enablers who
are the companies that are supplying
this Tech what they get out of all this
and the educational system behind it Etc
the challenges how to get from where we
think it should be to where we are now
so in brief we do see a lot of promising
advances I I mentioned with the 2020
Rome call for AI ethics and a consensus
emerging within the public in the
private sectors about how to translate
this I think you can say Global
understanding regardless of our belief
system regardless of our political
economic regimes regardless of our
sectors that we primarily reside in
there's an understanding that people
deserve better but also pragmatically we
need to do better and so as we saw for
instance with the Great Recession we saw
with the covid pandemic we're seeing
with a lot of the both the food and
energy crises globally and really
increasingly warming conflicts all over
the world
that if we don't help others then the
instability there travels everywhere
else we can't just say we're going to
quarantine our country from the disorder
or the challenges of everyone else nor
can we say we don't need help outside of
our borders to be able to help what's
happening inside of our borders and
that's where I think that Ai and Health
Care provide not only a needed urgence
intersection to improve the lives of
patients right now and to ensure that
that AI can be done responsibly for that
but also provides a paradigm a template
for how other sectors can do it as well
so to your point the primary ethical
challenges it seems that are emerging or
how do you scale responsible and
inclusive AI globally without losing the
local values and identity and agency of
the local population you're treating and
toward that we are seeing promising
advances of a lot of consensus
developing for instance in the American
model about trying to have have
responsible principle driven
corporations doing this work we're
seeing in Europe particularly with the
EU AI act emerging looking at a human
rights based approach of this regulation
and we're also seeing promising advances
for instance in China and India in the
African Union about how to be able to
reach
consensus on politically operational
ethical cultural values that's
responsive to the needs of one's
Community but at the same time benefits
from the global collaboration because is
ultimately if we're cutting ourselves
off from the global digital ecosystem
not only we're cutting ourselves off
from the markets where that Tech can get
better with not only we're cutting
ourselves off in the Innovation exchange
that but also we're cutting ourselves
off from the needs of humanity is I have
a in conclusion on this point I had a
great physician Mentor when I was being
trained that said that the best medical
researchers first the best medical
practitioners because if you're not at
the bedside listening to what the
patient needs you can't develop better
treatments for them and I think
similarly in the responsible AI world
for health if we're not listening to
people globally across sectors and
belief systems we don't know how to make
the kind of tech that Humanity
needs domic you uh raised the uh point
about global cooperation uh several
times uh there is this uh point that uh
currently AI is a English Western driven
uh large language models uh the CEO of
Nvidia uh encourag every country to
create their own model because it would
retain culture history
Etc uh the two points that come out from
you is should countries have their own
uh large language model and then in
terms of collaboration because right now
there is an AI and nationalism that is
going on because it's a matter of uh
pride in some cases National security
how do you kind of balance what you're
talking about cooperation especially on
health as you said listening to others
uh uh learning from others because it's
a global Community how do how does one
balance all of
that excellent question uh very
difficultly and
so if I can approach the question from a
different angle and then back up into
it an excellent strategic question that
I believe that it's combing Upon Our
Global and governments and institutional
leaders and corporate leaders to be able
to answer is in parallel from a top down
approach we need our leaders asking
tackling and resolving these tough
issues with popular consensus but bottom
up we also need people the community
engage in these kind of questions and we
see for instance in the chat gbt moment
for instance where all of a sudden AI
was promising and n and showing some
powerful Innovations but not yet it
seemed part of the public Consciousness
and then chat gbt comes out and all a
sudden we see the power of generative AI
you mentioned the AI nationalism which
seem to be particularly heating up at
the end of last year after the first few
months we see this meteoric arise of
like Microsoft with chat gbts backing
Nvidia supplying these high-end AI chips
and you're seeing the efficiency gains
of early adopter organizations that are
saying that you can get conservatively
20 to 30% efficiency gains in this kind
of work and in a way that is able to
respond to the demographic challenges
particularly in the global North where
we just don't have enough skilled labor
and in the global South where there's a
notable skills Gap where unfortunately
education is not catching up arguably
fast enough to meet the responsive needs
of their populations so chat gbt
therefore becomes this moment where as
you probably saw with the IMF report
last year looking at what over we expect
60% of job impact more in the develop
rather than developing world and not all
of it's going to be good and so there's
a a great Harvard Business Review that
argues that AI won't rep Place humans
but humans with AI will replace humans
without Ai and that becomes not only a
pragmatic not only a political question
for stability an economic question for
productivity more skilled labor equals
greater productive National and Global
economies but also an ethical challenge
it's not just for some to benefit more
than others that AI therefore becomes
simultaneously the greatest power
centralizer in human history small
number of Power Players control much of
where the dominant Tech is heading which
therefore controls most the global
digital ecosystem but also the greatest
arguably power decentralized where you
have not only at one hand the AI
nationalism that's developing
corporations and governments trying to
wrestle with how can we not get left
behind in the AI ons race but also you
have this amazing democratization of AI
where people are getting the power in
their hands in real time at a faster
life cycle of this Tech than we've ever
had before going from decades to just a
few weeks so for instance Microsoft's uh
CEO um a Saia I believe mentioned I
think a year ago at the world economic
Forum about that example on one hand the
excitement of chat gbt about how it's
helping Drive efficiency gains in the
corporate world but also how an Indian
farmer is able to use a version of it on
his smartphone in the field to navigate
the government assistance required to be
able to keep this keep his form going so
within those two power dynamics the
centralization and the decentralization
of AI to your point there does seem to
be an exciting
also concerning Trends where that
question is largely irrelevant Because
by the time we come up with a plan and
we implement it the ecosystems already
moved on so for instance the great work
the EU has done in the AI act very
impressive very important but it was
years ago that they already had launched
the effort and it's still not fully as I
understand ratified though it definitely
is needed and it's definitely efforts
like that should I think continue There
is at the same time separations
communities hospit hital that are saying
we need to do the work now the question
therefore becomes how do you reconcile
those two we have to have good strategy
but also good on on the ground
realization that people are not going to
wait for the regulations to catch up and
so I think that to your point efforts
like yours and the very influential
Community leader in this regard from the
governments to the institutions to the
corporations and the schools being able
to try to promote human centered
strategic design on this that stays
keeps essentially the tech R&D bounded
by the guardrails of human dignity and
rights in a way that's able to be a
common Global ethical language at the
same time understands the Practical
economics that it's going to keep going
before you put out your your regulations
and your um and your legal Frameworks
but at the same time providing that
democratization of AI as well where
you're trying to empower and inform
populations about how this work can be
done safely so therefore I think by
doing both the centralization of AI and
the decentralization of AI it allows the
power to be bounded by Justice and I
think that's a way that's not only
relevant impactful but also is urgently
needed the world over regardless of our
sector so uh the centralization and the
decentralization will potentially assist
us but you made one point about you know
the IMF report and others will
Physicians uh with AI replace Physicians
who don't have ai because you just
talked about that because your
profession is going to change
dramatically too yes sir I agree with
you and I think it already is
drastically happening on one hand we
don't know what's going to be the net
impact because on one hand we have a a
massive shortage of already physicians
in the US and also in the global North
and we see this concerning trend of the
global brain drain where you have
talented and ambitious Physicians from
the global South particularly in Africa
and we see in Asia as well coming to
arguably as it's been described the
global North the US and Europe in
particular seeking arguably better
opportunities Etc the challenge though
is that though urgently needed those
talented individuals here in the global
North are also desperately needed where
they came from as well and so the
argument is on one hand what's going to
be the net impact if are we going to
have a grain or a population aging in
the global North in our Workforce
including in the physician Workforce
faster than we're going to be able to
see the brain drain or or we can see
efficiency gains in AI so great in a
real push from the public and the
private sector we see a lot of this
particularly in the emerging
Partnerships between big us and European
tech companies and we see also promising
regards in India and China as well
trying to be able to take good
corporations pair them with big
International institutions and
governments try to form these kinds of
decolonized or posst imperialism
Partnerships where local communities are
able to drive the work they need
empowered by these Global networks and
thus we have more of a stabilization in
the co- capacity of ution in both the
North where we need more workers and the
South where there's the argument they
need more the tech enablement and to
your point about the phys workforce we
don't yet know where the trends are
heading but what we know now is that
right now we have a desperate shortage
of positions and that need is only going
to grow as we have growing numbers of
retirements of retirees have more and
more Healthcare needs that already
exceed the capacities of Healthcare
Systems already under strain postco so
we do see not only the ethical argument
that good responsible AI can make care
more accessible and affordable for
larger populations who need it but we
also see the pragmatic and the economic
argument that it needs to be done are
these hospitals increasingly risk
shrinking operation operating margins
that imperil their abilities to Sly care
for their communities so to your point
there's a lot of exciting I think we can
argue is Project or operational level AI
advances looking at how for instance you
can have mammograms for breast cancer
screenings done more effectively by a
radiologist that's able instead of just
read what r one radiologist reads but
what happens if you have 10 AI
algorithms that are running 10
Radiologists worth of algorithm of
images we see already a lot of working
this in Ghana in Sudan that's very
exciting so you don't trade efficiency
your safety the reads are still accurate
you still have the human in the loop the
radiologist confirming the reads
accurate but you can drastically
increase productivity but it's not just
enough to have those kinds of
operational level advances we need also
the Strategic level or capacity level
advances and that's where we see
promising work for instance with mayo
clinics platform initiative or Cleveland
clinics partnership with IBM and the
quantum computer the first
commercialized Health computer we see
promising advances with a lot of big
systems that are not just saying how can
we do nice AI that sounds good for press
releases not saying that systems are
principally driven by that but how can
we make sure it's a strategy wide
enterprise-wide mature AI to make sure
that both the clinical side but also the
operational side of healthcare both the
medicine and the business side of
healthcare are able to both be improved
responsibly with an AI cycle that can do
the whole thing more effectively and
transparently for patient populations to
maintain societal trust and patient
buyin but also do so at a stable and
sustainable growing operating margin and
therefore we do see already rapid
advances to your point that it's not so
much a displacement or a job replacement
it's a question rather of how can we
meet the needs of our patients which is
inherently and I think necessary meaning
it's more AI to make up for the less
Physicians coming in but it's trying to
augment and enhance the care of the
patient to touch the hand of a dying
patient at bedside where the AI
ultimately can't reach so to know where
AI can help but also know where you
still desperately need the human touch
so augment uh the capabilities and needs
of uh Physicians and patients is what
you're saying Dominic uh at an
operational and a strategic level uh
Let's uh delve a little bit into some of
your uh very very uh interesting work
the only thing I would say to you is our
audience are not all triple doctorates
uh like you so uh you might uh keep your
answers given that in mind uh we have
developed uh innovate Innovative
methodologies like bam uh PS
transnational statistics and AI Health
ma mathematical models can you explain
how these tools are transforming
Healthcare yes sure and so I'm I'm
hoping it's transforming Healthcare at
least efforts like it or so I tried with
bam PS and a few other methodologies
I've tried to propose and develop over
the last few years and I've tried to
provide it as much as Open Access as
possible free of charge to readers uh
globally by trying to detail the
methodologies that essentially are meant
to be able to bring the clinical side of
healthcare what works and what doesn't
work does treatment a work better than
treatment B but also the cost
Effectiveness can you afford as a
hospital system to provide treatment a
rather than treatment B but also the
cost of the inequities societally about
what happens if we don't do that and you
combine all that from an from an ethical
framework I've developed a framework I
try to propose as something called the
the personalist social contract where
you try to take the world's diverse
belief systems as you also therefore
able to therefore identify what are the
common substantive values we have in uh
that we share
namely can we believe that the patient
deserves good care what does that
actually mean at a practical level
day-to-day and you take that and you
develop an ethical framework that's able
to be articulated in the language we
have that's dominant in both modern AI
big tech companies and our Global
governments and we hear it a lot with
the United Nations as well that concept
of the dignity or the value of the
person irrespective of their power or
their societal value that the person has
that value there and and you translate
that kind of ethical framework in a way
that's able to integrate that full
pipeline of decision- making the same
way that for instance a physician at
bedside when I walk up to a patient in
most Physicians I believe we walk up
trying to ask what's wrong how do we fix
it how can we at least accompany the
patient by trying to make their lives
better so we're already as Physicians
trying to be able to combine the
clinical the cost effectivess and the
ethical side so what I've tried to do in
my methodologies including with bam PS
is to try to be able to digitalize that
b process to digitalize human dignity in
a way that is readable and
understandable by the AI algorithms and
in a way that's also profitable and
sustainable for our Health Care Systems
to be able to support it and so that
kind of methodology with bam PS is one
I've used in a number of my recent
studies that try to show not only how to
advance in specific concrete domains for
instance with cardio oncology or
patients who have cancer and heart
disease for instance with a recent
publication on Cardiac Arrest about if a
patient's stops how do you restart it
and help the patient heal and better yet
how do you prevent that heart stopping
in the first place like my grandfather
mentioned in the beginning of this
discussion so those kind of
methodologies are meant to try to be
able to not only show how we can help
right now those patient populations from
cardio oncology to Public Health to
Global Health but also to be able to
show the mathematics behind it to show
how it can be how it can be applied and
adapted and scaled for other research
teams and other Healthcare Systems
globally so bam PS was a attempt to be
able to try to show that and my hope
therefore is that that can be part of
the continuing larger story of ai's
digital transformation of healthcare
that people don't have to use my
algorithm but I think it has to be
something like that where we bring
together not some but all members of the
global ecosystem and the Human
family so from uh BPS let's Shi to the
another model that you have uh come up
with is can you give an overview of your
banan machine and deep learning augment
propensity score approach and how does
it Advance Health Equity right so what
it essentially is and how it works
particularly for health and Equity is
it's meant to try to be able to ask in
real time what works and what doesn't
work but we're significantly limited by
the current R&D life cycle in in
healthcare namely as you're probably and
as or your readers and listeners aware
unfortunately it takes generally about a
decade and about a billion dollars to
bring a drug to Market and largely most
of those fail ultimately and so we don't
have as we saw for instance in the co
pandemic you can't say to the world
everyone just PA stop where you're at
we're going to figure this out over a
few years we're going to come back to
you you have patients that are getting
sick right now patients that are dying
right now and we can't pause people's
lives to get evidence-based care to them
and so what that approach was the beian
uh approach was a way to be able to
combine essentially the best of what we
have from a mathematics standpoint so
you take take the beian side which is a
way generally speaking to be able to
understand right now what's the most
likely prediction you can make on a
given treatments being better than the
other treatments based upon everything
you've known before because most of our
medical statistics most of our research
right now is unfortunately though
helpful it's about a century old and
doesn't work very well it essentially is
a very two-dimensional very narrow view
statistics what's happening before how
do you predict what's happening next but
what AI brings to it and what beian
analyses bring to it is a much more
realistic and accurate understanding of
how we are right now so as a patient if
you're clutching your chest and you
realize you may have heart problems you
need to hurry up and get in your car and
get to the hospital but you're not just
going to get in your car and just drive
straight you're going to use what you've
known before how to get to the hospital
to adjust in real time your prediction
of what's the fastest way to get to the
hospital that's kind of what thean anal
do you're updating your knowledge what's
happened before to help better predict
what's going to happen next so with my
methodology there with the BAM PS and
with the beian analysis you mentioned
that's meant to update the most accurate
predictions you can based on what's
happened before but AI helps you do it
at a much more complex and real-time
scale than what you've had before
because unfortunately most of our
medical research still runs on a a
pretty standard basic way not just of
the old school math but also the old
school computation you put a bunch of
things into a uh into a statistical
software program like a blender you turn
it on you get what you can out of it
what we need is more of a real time
understanding of what's happening with
the complexity of the data and in real
time so rather than trying to make the
medical reality essentially condense and
conform to the simplistic way of
computing and analyzing data it's meant
to be able to let us conform to the
reality to understand hey patience don't
stop what you're doing we will come to
you you won't have to come to us and so
the methodology I developed with the
beian analysis is meant to help try to
do that so AI gives you complexity in
real time Aion gives you greater
arguable accuracy and richness in
analysis and that integrated analysis
otherwise with bringing the ethics and
the cost Effectiveness to it is meant to
allow you to translate clinically
relevant and cost-efficient results into
a way that's economically viable for the
decision makers for the hospitals but
also for taxpayers who largely are going
to have on this and sorry to for your
point please and to your point about
Equity what does all this mean is that
as we have an explosion of Health
equities about $250 billion a year in
the us alone upwards we believe about a
trillion dollar by 240 we can't afford
not to do this kind of work we can't
afford to just say okay let's sit around
and let our Tech get smart enough to
where it can run healthcare for us we
need patient answers now and so what my
methodology tries to do with the BAM PA
s and with those other related
methodologies I proposed is a way to try
to be able to essentially take smarter
analytics in real time with greater
complexity understand what works best
and provide therefore the best options
to Providers to healthcare leaders and
to publ to allow a more informed
decision together about how we're going
to move forward and that's where the
inequities comes in you don't have to
use it as an addan analysis at the very
end of all this it's buil in the very
beginning because arguably good patient
care is going to be good ethical and E
Equitable and efficient care so you
therefore scale that globally it means
you don't have to choose between do you
take care of the rich or the poor
patient it means you have to do both not
only can you not afford to exclude one
or the other but also ethically it's not
permissible but also finally Health Care
means our duty to care doesn't allow us
to prioritize one over the other and
therefore that's where I think the
promise of a lot of these kind of
methodologies um rise from the equity is
not an afterthought it's the first
thought how do I care for the patient
regardless of their
need so how do I care about the patient
regardless of the need you care for the
wealthy and you care for everyone else
um just moving shifting a little bit
towards data privacy how do you uh
navigate uh the balance between data
privacy and the utility of AI and
healthc Care we've had uh you know uh
different guests come in and talk to us
that uh you know these llms are scraping
uh patient data um and you know the
patients need to have uh a stake in
let's say discovery that comes through
so that's that's uh one question and
then I will have another question based
on something you said about the long
life cycle of drou but uh talk to us a
little bit about data privacy and uh in
AI
Healthcare excellent question I think
it's a ethically strategic but also a
technically practical question so from
the ethically strategic angle that
because the global Supply chains to even
produce this Tech is so complex I mean
you're spending multiple countries
multiple companies and multiple sectors
to be able to achieve the kind of tech
you have to play nice in the sandbox
globally to make this stuff work the
Freer the exchange of ideas and
Innovation and people the better
technology you're going to get that's
also the more profitable and so
therefore the economics requires also
the political stability spanning all
these Supply chains and these sectors to
be able to achieve this so from a
strategic level we need to be able to
make sure that it works for people and
therefore one of this it seems principal
understandable public concerns of this
is how do I make sure not only does the
algorithm work but is it built in a way
that I'm not worried about the security
of my privacy and my data very fair
question like in medicine you don't want
to give a medicine that's going to hurt
more than it helps and so
from a strategic and ethical standpoint
we see a lot of promise and what I've
tried to do in my work as well in
particular with the computational ethics
or how do you do ethics based upon what
the empirical results inform for you is
to try to be able to build in therefore
those ethical saf course into the R&D
process from the very beginning at a
structural and strategic level but also
from a technical level it allows us
therefore when we're asking the right
questions when you frame the problem
well from the initial standpoint that
strategic empathy as it's described what
does the enduser the end patients the
community you're trying to serve need
and therefore you engineer you reverse
engineer rather the products and
services from an AI standpoint required
to get you to that point whether it be
Healthcare whether it be e-commerce Etc
so when you frame and put ethical
safeguards on the problem well in the
first point then you can give the
technical practical solutions that are
needed such that you don't have to worry
when you get a product that works
technically whether people are going to
trust it at all so that's where we're
coming in for instance with things like
learning and Federated learning models
where as you may be familiar with in
your your listeners you have the ability
where we Ed to just say we're going to
take a bunch of results from patients
charts we're going to put it into a big
spreadsheet and we're going to analyze
results we're going to spit it out but
not only is that slow and inefficient
but also by the time you go to treat the
patient that patient is long gone as is
the need of the patient so then multiple
evolutions of this and AI helping with
this good ethically strategic and
structurally sound AI is able to to help
deliver better results to patients that
still maintains and optimizes societal
trust and reliability of this so for
instance with swarm learning and
different techniques that are coming out
like it we're better able to be able to
say if you have for instance three
different hospitals in three different
parts of the world then how can you keep
not only your data locally rather than
having to put it together and send it to
somewhere overseas and therefore the
concerns about the security of that data
transfer how you keep it anonymized Etc
and also Al the concerns about the
essentially the postcolonial impacts of
that it brings up very painful memories
understandably for many parts of the
world where like we extracted minerals
in the 1700s and 1800s from one part of
the world shipped them to another part
of the world where they used them to
consumer goods similarly you can argue
that the digital imperialism of a lot of
the current models you can't just take
data from one part of the world and
train AI somewhere else to benefit
populations elsewhere so what we're
seeing is that co-design Global local
model developed so where you keep the
data locally but also you keep the AI
locally but importantly you're able to
have the AI that through appropriate
strategic and ethical safeguards are
able to learn from the data and AI from
the all the other sites so therefore
everyone learns together but you don't
lose the security or the locality of
your data or your individual communities
who benefit from it and so therefore
those exciting technical evolutions and
Innovations I propose at least are
accelerated by and in many cases come
from first asking the right questions
how do you maintain the trust and the
relevance of this for the user for the
patient and therefore you reverse
engineer your Tech to be able to do
so so reverse engineer the tech um
Dominic um in health care for data
privacy we have Hippa uh do you think uh
as AI becomes and they say Healthcare is
got the most promise for AI but we've
had many guests many members of Congress
Etc who said the promise of AI and
Healthcare do incredible do you think we
need a specific legislation whether it
is for privacy or security or Equity or
any of those specific to Ai and
Healthcare yes and no this is where it
gets back to that earlier question I
thought you also brought up that was
very insightful how do you make sure
those that have power use it wisely
justly and effectively and how can
populations as well empowered with the
knowledge and tools to also co-design
and co-develop this well at the same
time so it's not a question of the
populations versus the powers are vice
versa so I think this is an excellent
practical regulatory implication of that
earlier question so there's I think a
very helpful analysis done a little
while back on the Brussels effect as it
was coined I Believe by an NYU Professor
about that importance of the competing
regulatory Frameworks and this is only
heating up in the data in the AI World
mentioned earlier about the arguably the
Rivalry of the regulatory regimes of EU
the US and China if you have more of a
respectively rights driven versus
business-driven versus State driven
regulatory approach and so the challenge
is if that's where most of the tech is
going then by default most of the AI and
the data governance models globally are
therefore going to follow from there so
if you have the US that appears to have
a largely shifted a lot of the onus on
companies to self-regulate and that's a
simplification but generally I think we
can argue that and in China they more of
a state driven the challenge though is
that there's um I think we can argue
maybe stronger um maybe barriers or
hurdles between their internal markets
and elsewhere so it's difficult to have
these three competing regulatory
Frameworks talk to each other let alone
standardize so that corporations can
make a product for one company or one
market like the EU being the largest
single Market that's not going to
conflict with regulatory requirements
for instance in the US China and the
global South so the Brussels effect
effect therefore we are seeing that as
you probably know that effect where you
have more of the stringent human rights
based approaches to say that some tech
just can never be done it's going to
hurt people more than it's going to help
them some tech we need to be more
cautious with and therefore some tech we
don't have to be CAU much at all with so
therefore you have a risk stratification
approach to try to simplify regulations
such that it's the minimum necessary to
put appropriate safeguards in place to
optimize the individual well-being and
individual well-being at global scale so
you have Humanity's well-being not just
the local populations and the local
patients and therefore you do see that
leading role practically of the Brussels
effect where you see for instance the EU
AI act where companies in the US and
China are already building into that
compliance by Design to their products
anticipating challenges down the road if
they don't do so with the largest single
Market in the EU and therefore that kind
of standardization or self
standardization of compliance by Design
does seem that we're we're having that
essentially the Brussels effect
propagating throughout the rest of the
world and therefore the question becomes
well we still can't just delegate this
to Market forces we so just can't say
we'll let someone else deal with our own
regulation particularly because what
happens if EU regulation doesn't
appropriately reflect the political
economic realities and the cultural
identity of a population on the other of
the planet so therefore we are seeing
promising advances for instance with the
United Nations General Assembly or
Advisory board on AI uh the UNESCO
boards a lot of the big Healthcare
organizations and Global associations
all starting the own process of self
discussion of these things and though it
has been critiqued on that concept of
principal proliferation where everyone's
just putting out their own AI guidelines
and standards and we see for instance
only I believe as it currently stands
right now less than 16% of healthcare
organizations in the the us alone have
actual AI policies and but the substance
of it is questionable and how you apply
it or enforce it is even more so so we
are seeing promising effects that I if I
go back to that concept of the
centralization and the decentralization
of AI or the top down and bottom up
approach I think it's a good thing when
people are empowered with knowledge I
think it's a good thing when we use that
knowledge even if it's messy in the
public debate on what do we do together
to reach consensus that we then
operationalize and reg ations standards
norms and laws so though you can argue
the merits are the lack thereof for
instance of just releasing Chad gbt and
therefore all these generative AI
algorithms that are coming out a lot of
questions if it's right is it not is it
doing more harm than good appropriate
questions but you still have essentially
decentralized organic regulation at a
population level people are already
helping to identify the problems that it
would have taken a lot longer should you
have developed this in isolation away
from populations so you just can't
release Tech though without any
safeguards but there is a role to play I
think in that to your point on
regulation the self-regulation of
populations and public discourse as a
consensus emerges as people interact
with as much of the ethically safe or
guard rail based Tech as possible so
populations can help identify
collectively here are the concerns that
we have locally and globally at the same
time that you have a proliferation of
these ethical conventions and
regulations and norms and standards
because we are seeing a standardization
gradually developing based on a gradual
Global consensus on what is the
appropriate agile adaptive and still
accountable and responsible regulatory
Global regime on this long story short
the people with power need to ask these
tough questions the people without it
need to be able to say what they need
and I think together we will be able to
converge our various power Dimensions
into a way that is a more just Equitable
and effective world on this so the
people with power need to ask and the
people uh without the power need to
raise these issues uh Dominic uh Dominic
just briefly uh what do you think is the
importance of interdisciplinary
collaboration and advancing AI driven
healthc Care Solutions You' talked about
global collaborations what about some
interdisciplinary
collaboration I think there is no AI
without collaboration and so I'm a
physician but in my other world in
between patients I have to do the
science actually Divine devise and
deploy the algorithms also as an ethesis
with that hat on I have to think about
what's responsible as well and how do
you practically put policies in place
that can Implement these kind of
Innovations you develop so in brief the
co-design model of AI I really believe
in where you have to at the very
beginning not after the fact but you in
the very beginning you have patients
community members healthc Care
Professionals data scientists policy
makers and leaders and government
officials as well all at the table at
the same time where you're trying to ask
the questions what do people need how
can we do it responsibly and affordably
and how can we continue to scale it and
you do see promising advances at a
concrete level for instance like noted
earlier with mayo clinics platform with
Cleveland Clinic and a few other
organizations that is part of a smart
business strategy of Enterprise wide or
mature AI that is not just in certain
projects but you try to put AI
throughout the entire
organization responsibly at the same
time it takes a mature interdisiplinary
strategy where the mature strategy says
that you're not just going to only
listen to a patient's for when you walk
up to the patient as a physician you're
also going to be thinking how can I
apply the probability of treatment a
working better than treatment B but also
ethically how do I do so in a way that's
responsible for the patient's needs so
as a provider you already think across
all these different disciplines so I
think our AI strategy has to reflect
that not just our business models so AI
strategy should reflect uh
interdisciplinary models across the
board uh Dominic uh finally I mean I
have so many other things to talk about
but uh you actually have people to take
care of uh so finally what message would
you like to leave our listeners with
about the future of AI in shaping a more
Equitable and healthier
World excellent question please keep
doing what you're doing from your uh
very influential platform to that of
your
listeners we just need people to care we
just need people to care about better
health for them their families their
communities and the global Human family
and therefore doing that the natural
opportunities to take advantage of in
people's respective expertise and
domains will come to light so I think
the great insights of AI is that it's
not just the power people that are
driving it it's all of us so if we want
a better world AI will help us get there
and so therefore we just need people to
keep doing what they can at a local
level to make what's around them better
and therefore at scale so will the rest
of the
world so people uh keep doing what they
are ask questions and get engaged is
what uh Dominic's uh parting words are
for our listeners uh thank you for
tuning in to this episode of regulating
AI we extend our deep gratitude to
Dominique for sharing his invaluable
insights into the ethical dimensions of
AI and Healthcare and Beyond as we
continue to navigate the complexities of
regulating AI let's keep these
conversations alive and inclusive
ensuring that our regulatory Frameworks
reflect the diverse perspectives and
priorities of our Global Community stay
tuned for more thought-provoking
discussions and intersections of AI
ethics and regulations Dominque thank
you again really this has been uh uh a
very very insightful uh conversation
I've learned a lot I'm sure our
listeners have learned a lot would love
to have you because at least 30
questions I had more but uh thank you
again so much and this is Sanjay Puri
signing off uh and you can see about
Dominic he's got four books uh in a show
notes so thank you Dominic thanks for
being with us than me
