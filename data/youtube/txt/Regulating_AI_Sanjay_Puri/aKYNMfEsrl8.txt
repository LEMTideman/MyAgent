I think this technology linked with the
national security and technological
decisions something intentionally being
being not to integrate but to separate
you know this is not new you know but I
think from my two perspective we always
say look guys but we all need to have
the technology we all need to agree how
it will be kind of working together we
need to agree how it will be
interoperate so at least let's figure
out how many how far we can go with that
before before there's a divergence
happens we find that standardization
part can move pretty quickly because
sanization pieces first of all is about
interested people coming together to
develop something.
>> Welcome to the regulating AI podcast.
Join host Sanjay Pury as he explores the
dynamic and developing world of
artificial intelligence governance. Each
episode features deep dives with global
leaders at the forefront of regulating
AI responsibly, tackling the challenges
using AI can bring about headon and
enabling balance without hindering
innovation.

Welcome to regulating AI the podcast
promoting responsible ethical and
trustworthy AI practices globally. I'm
your host Sanjay Puri and today we are
honored to have with us Tomas
Lammanoskas the deputy secretary general
of the international telecommunications
union ITU. Tomas brings truly a unique
perspective to AI governance, combining
over 20 years of international
leadership experience across four
continents. Starting his career as a
computer science teacher in Lithuania,
he's since led telecommunications
regulatory authorities in Europe, the
Middle East, and the Caribbean and
advised governments in the Pacific and
worked with multip uh national
corporations across 13 countries. His
academic foundation is equally
impressive. A law degree from Villainous
University, a master's in
telecommunications regulations from the
University of the West Indies, and an
MPA from Harvard Kennedy School, and
leadership training from the London
Business School. Wow, that's a handful.
uh but as the deputy secretary general
of ITU the UN's specialized agency for
ICT Tomas now overseas initiatives
connecting nearly 8 billion people
worldwide and he's spearheaded the AI
for good global summit that brought
together 11,000 participants from 169
countries
which we were very lucky to be
participant uh in and it was a fabulous
uh conference as welcome to the
regulating AI podcast.
>> Thank you much Sanji and thank you very
much for this wonderful introduction.
You know I'm I'm really happy you had so
many facts in so thank you much.
>> Oh wonderful Tomas uh you we were really
uh you know grateful to be a part of uh
an incredible conference which is AI for
good in Geneva uh about a month or so
ago. uh for our listeners who are global
listeners uh policy leaders uh
entrepreneurs think tank expert firstly
just could you just briefly especially
for people who don't know what is the
ITU
u and then how do you see ITU's unique
role in shaping AI regulation
uh and what advantage does a
telecommunication focused agency UN
agency bring to AI governance can you'll
let our listeners know So thank you my
son and I again mean immediately a
little bit address this aspect also the
telecommunications focused you know in
my my my inter my conversation here as
well. So first of all IU is United
Nations agency for digital technologies.
So we did we did start quite a while ago
160 years ago so double the age of
United Nations now we celebrates 80
years this year we celebrated 160 at
that time to regulate and ensure
crossber operation of the what was then
groundbreaking technology of telegraph
in my in the recent event moderator
actually kind of read out for audience
what electric telegraph is I was a bit
surprised but maybe I'm geek you know so
I thought that everyone learns that
still at the school but just maybe for
the audience that may not have done
that. So electric telegraph it was
basically original way through the wires
to exchange information electronically
you know and sometimes if you hear in
the movies is beep beep beep beep beep.
So that's the kind of impression of
telegraph and morse code and other
things how people would communicate in
that time. So when telegraph was
invented initially it would work only
within the borders and then to make sure
it works across the borders. So that's
where standards needed to be agreed in
among the nations and that's why they
set up what what was at that time
international telegraph union signing
international telegraph convention in
Paris. So that was 160 years ago. Since
then of course it was always in the
forefront of different technological
revolutions. I would say what we now
would call digital technology but of
course in in that time there was the
digital had a bit of a different meaning
still. So from telegraph we went to the
wireless you know so maybe simply to say
you know your mobile phone needs
wireless you know so because that's how
it connects to the global global network
but also your microphone that use a
stage is connected by wireless your you
know Bluetooth headphones also you know
use wireless you know and everything
around the world in these in this kind
of invisible radio waves you know that
connect all the devices. So ITU started
in the early 20th century regulating
that agreeing globally how different
radio waves would be used. It's also
thatization is key because for
manufacturers to produce a devices that
they need to know that those devices
would be used in the same way in
different parts of the world. So that
was very important. Then we went to
satellites and again in 1957 the first
satellite was launched in space. In 1963
the first conference was what we called
uh world administrative space conference
which is specifically on how to regulate
the emerging space sector especially
from radio radio context but again
because for the satellites to operate uh
they need radio waves you know but then
when what we realize as well that also
is not only the radio waves but also
place in orbit so that they can find
their own space there. So that is a new
new technology that again it had to uh
had to embrace and then in '90s what was
also realized it's not only about
standardization and technological
progress it's about having it available
to all. So in the 90s we added the our
development arm which is now called
development sector or which is supported
by our bureau of bureau of development
which is basically focuses on
democratizing if you will technology
bring and in that moment as well
successive let's say waves of
technological change and it had to be at
the forefront of that from the internet
and all the kind of all the underlying
uh digital infrastructure to of course
the mobile revolution that changed the
way people connect to the telecoms but
then all the application layer what we
call and then of course now artificial
intelligence metaverse quantum and other
things you know because just to give
example why why I'm saying it's not just
telecoms and then this AI the AI piece
is not not uh surprising is because you
know if you look at it history as well
for example and what we're known for for
example video codecs and uh and uh
broadcasting quality for those we
actually have a number of Emmy awards
and again some some people don't know
that there are MME awards for
engineering and it actually is a hold of
quite a few of them and then uh and then
at the same time for example rather
famous public key infrastructure
basically the underlying infrastructure
for electronic and digital signatures
that's again a huge standardized aspect
as well so I think it's I think it's
more appropriate these days to say we
are have a very strong roots in telecoms
and of course that is still a very
strong foundational element of ITU you
know these pipes that bring the
additional information around the world
but at the same time other layers of
that technology applications the current
today we're calling also add digital
public infrastructure so creating this
enabling layer for education for health
for public services and then going to
these technology intelligence all of
that is within the ITU's scope and
mandate and and and activities as well
>> wow uh from telegraph to mobile to
satellite to now AI. Thomas um AI is
moving exceptionally rapidly probably uh
from in talking to a lot of my guests
unlike any other technology. You build
standards around telegraph around
telecommunications around satellites.
How is this different? I mean with
something that is moving so rapidly do
you think uh standardization and would
that stop innovation because is it
innovation first standards first uh I
mean that's the debate that's at least
happening in the US right now what are
what is itu's perspective on that
>> thank you and again on this word rapidly
because I think being a 160 years
organization we sometimes have a
perspective a little bit different on
things you know and it's like in the
same like we see things like you know in
telecoms things. So from one hand things
move very rapidly different technologies
different generations different
applications but then submarine cable
has been there now for for some decades
you know and they kind of they are the
bulk of how the information is carried
in the same way AI you know we of course
since chipt kind of brought that to
everyone's attention 2022 we see this
rapid revolution but look when in my
high school I was learning about neural
networks as well you know and I was kind
of poking around and and sometimes I
give this example to people that for now
for a few decades every time you get a
speeding ticket and your your your
camera takes the picture of your number
plate and then translates from the
picture to numbers. That's a AI at work.
I mean more simplified AI than ch but
this AI is a neural networks is a you
know and and the way those neural
networks learn how to convert from
picture to number is not so different
how neural networks learn how to
actually produce uh those different
words from the bulk from the vast amount
of information they have and then
numbers but of course is a scaling loss
you know much more power uh much more
much more computing power is thrown at
it much more data is thrown at it and of
course now the consumer products are
becoming much more much more accessible.
So so that is the perspective you know.
So of course and that's why you didn't
start AI in 2022 you know actually you
know if you look at our flagship and you
mentioned AI for good summit so the
first edition of air for good summit was
in 2017 and and the first time United
Nations convened what we now call inter
agency working group on AI which brings
UN family together and led by the UN and
UNESCO was in 2020. So that's already
pretty recent and then of course a lot
of other developments and discussions
about AI were way before that. So I
think having that perspective helps
because having that perspective allows
us to distinguish things that really
change very rapidly and the things that
actually remain relatively stable and I
think there thereby there are different
layers there. I think standards actually
in many ways is an answer rather than a
challenge in this kind of fast moving
environment because I think the question
a lot of people ask how you I'm sure
that regulation environment policy
environment governing environment you
know is it can adapt to this technology
revolution that's what we learn from
telecoms and others that you have to
have this multi-layer governance that
first at the top of it says policies you
know that kind of where the governments
agree on ethical requirements on
consumer requirements on the technology
needs to be brought to everyone so it's
a very high level principles, you know,
then there's the regulations that kind
of translate those principles in the
rules and then there's a standards that
then allow technology
to adapt and to be matched to those
regulations and policies. Now sometimes
you know if if you don't do it right
then people try the policy on regulation
to codify everything and then of course
things don't move very fast you know
because first of all it's difficult to
agree and then once you agree the
technology would would already have
changed by that. So that's why this
having that full full ecosystem of
instruments if you will of the way of
approaches to govern things and
technology and to kind of come together
is really useful. We find that
standardization part can move pretty
quickly because standardization pieces
first of all is about interested people
coming together to develop something you
know and usually it's is a very
collaborative way it's not only just
governments as a governments it's
academia it's private sector it's other
stakeholders and that's what it is
pretty unique to an agency in that
regard because we we not only have 194
member states we also have uh more than
1,000 uh the what we call sector members
so these means all the other
stakeholders that actually have a
membership
and they participate in that protest in
pretty rapid way and you can iterate you
know so you can do one standard you can
do another version of standard as
technology evolves and then you can help
match that standard development as they
say to regulatory and policy uh policy
requirements there of course innovation
look I think it's also innovation
cutting edge is done by you know by
different by private sector by research
centers you know sometimes by
governments and of course this is their
the cutting edge technology this is
whether that needs to be I think what it
comes into play as an agency and as a
standard development organization where
the technology needs to be available to
everyone either you know both for you
know commercial reasons because the
companies and and others want to want to
expand their markets markets and when
you have a standard that makes it more
acceptable in other markets and also
lowers the cost of technology
development because of you know we can
can reach more markets and also for
public public policy interest you know
public policy reasons because you then
through theization again make the
technology more available to everyone
you know you you encourage
interperability or in telecom's world we
call interconnection so that means like
different kind of different islands of
technology can work together so these
worlds like actually drive each other
you know so we need innovation sometimes
proprietary innovation to go very fast
and and and bring these new ideas and
opportunities but then standardization
comes there to play to actually make
sure that that innovation can spread and
can be adopted by many people.
>> Standardization can be adopted. Uh I
think it's very well said Thomas. Uh do
you feel like from a standards
perspective there is not an enforcement
mechanism that you have? Do you believe
that kind of holds you back? I mean what
what is it that you can actually from a
standard standpoint enforce I'm talking
now AI uh etc. uh how do you balance
that? I mean first of all it is a part
of ecosystem you know so it's not a you
know beginning or endall you know I
think we have a very important role in
ecosystem but we part of ecosystem it's
the enforcement role most of the times
falls onto national governments you know
and then and the national governments
can actually have this policy decisions
and then enforcement actions to actually
ensure compliance what they do is there
is to help those national governments in
many ways do the job in a way that
actually is not disruptive to the
private sector and encourages innovation
but but then at the same time allows it
to the job. So for example, having a two
standard makes much easier for the
government to regulate because they
don't need to say every time the
government doesn't need to invent a new
new regul set set of regulations, set of
rules, set of standards quote unquote
the government can say look you know
whatever or the standardization body
said at this time agreed that is that is
requirement and that's been you know for
a long time for example telecom
telecommunications qual of service that
was the way you know if you look a lot
of country regulations they would simply
refer to a two standard and we say look
you know whatever standard at the time
is that's kind of what you need to
comply with and then as the technology
develops so then a standard would
develop and then governments would
naturally automatically through
incorporation or through reference would
would there say regulatory framework
would update and in a way that's what
the EU and other sanization bodies give
it to their blood broad system so give
this agreed most of time consensually
sets of rules sets of protocol sets of
sets of standards which then different
stakeholders can use whether to
incorporate that in the national
regulatory frameworks, international or
regional regulatory frameworks or to
self- adopt and so certify you know and
sometimes you know so those players can
say look this is the standard I comply
with you know sometimes these standards
can be referred into the procurement uh
rules and regulations or contracts so
this is the way to actually move uh move
the governance without like immediately
imposing something but using that
plethora of plethora of other let's say
enforcement mechanisms whether it's a
national whether it's contractual
whether it's other ways another piece
which is very important I think is
broader than standards but it's also
like a general our convening power is
the shining the light and I think the
shining the light is also important
because then you know when you say to
the people look this is how some set of
people do it some people other people do
it through that you can encourage people
to comply with different rules and
standards like what we do with our green
digital action initiative.
>> We're bringing stakeholders who say they
care about digital industry to be
sustainable and contributing to the
fighting climate change and then through
that we then push them to adopt some
standards
and back up their words with a specific
commitments you know and then we kind of
track that. So while shining the light
you also kind of you know self
enforcement encourage self enforcement
and soft enforcement and finally which
sounds the softest out of that but
actually a lot of time is very impactful
is is a place is a venue and that's
where UN part of it comes in is a venue
to kind of s agree and signal global
values and global principles and global
objectives you know because when you
kind of signal that and you say look the
local community is interested in that
it's very often it's not a mere words
because that drives other policy
decisions that drives national
discussions on what are the right
policies that drives discussions between
private sector and the government that
drives uh that drives corporate policies
and and corporate initiatives from the
private sector side because they want to
align with that. You know like always
you know the good example is that kind
of sustainable development goals agenda
which is kind of you know has a lot of
self- adoption no so and if you think oh
yeah but this is just a framework but
then you see how many groups of people
actually say no we want to align in this
this is what you do because of that and
I think the same with all these other
discussions is about having those
frameworks and then here for example
ethical frameworks on AI and and and
discussions about you know that you know
about environmental impact of AI that
then drive those discussions on
different other layers and and say okay
no we actually need to think about that
when we when we do something nationally
or corporate on the corporate level.
>> No so uh I think you made three key
points uh here for our listeners. One is
uh the standards become a guiding light
for countries maybe to adopt easily. Hey
they can point to ITU but then also
there is a shining light. So it makes
companies or whatever else stakeholders
hey are we following these standards
maybe gives them a competitive edge and
finally it gives a location or a place
to convene the UN etc for different
different uh stakeholders. I think
that's a very important uh uh
perspective Thomas
uh
uh you said bringing people together and
I don't know in terms of telegraph and
telecom right now it seems like there
are three centers of AI governance that
are developing the EU has the uh you
know the EU AI act the US has basically
an America uh first innovation and China
has more a state-driven um AI
governance. They just announced that
they also want a global governance
perspective.
Looking at what has happened before in
ITU or how you see this kind of
groupings, what is uh your perspective
on how this kind of plays out in the
mission that ITU has in terms of AI
governance and standards? I think first
of all that different approaches is is
nothing nothing very original in a way
you know because we even had that in
much more narrower telecoms world you
know we had you know we had sometimes if
you look at third generation mobile
telecommunications it was much more kind
of regionally based and before that just
maybe even had a big split between say
North American standards or American
standards and European standards but
then if you look now the 4G adoption is
actually became more kind of integrative
And actually you know like we of course
as a two would like to believe that and
we see some examples from telecoms world
the more global approaches the more
successful and fast roll out it is but
at the same time especially when it's a
new technology or a relatively new
technology in the policy makaker's eyes
and and in the kind of adopters eyes I
think experimentation is very healthy
thing to have and I think it's it's
useful to have these different
approaches and to see which one will
have its own advantages and which will
pursue different environments as well
you know because I think different
different cultural environments and
different historical environments also
drive adoption technologies you know
like I remember this discussion you know
like in Scandinavia and even you know
Lithia where I am you know we always
like to kind of talk about like where
I'm from from like this whole idea about
you know single IDs single digital IDs
you know having the single databases you
know like you know from your health
system you know your health system
connected with your kind of employment
system and the driver's license and you
have like this very useful governing
system in some countries countries that
have a bit of a different history that's
a big no no you know like and people say
no no no I don't want government to know
everything about me you know whereas in
some countries say no no I actually want
that want that usefulness of everything
government knowing everything about me
so that they don't need to kind of bring
that information every time to different
government agencies this is an example
from nonAI world that that it's not just
about like um which approach is best but
it's also about like a different
cultures and different societies have
their own different approaches to the
technology I think with artificial
intelligence we are now at that stage
and those different approaches are
probably most fitted for the societies
that kind of have them. Now what ATU is
there to do and organizations like ours
is to bring them all together and to
allow them to share those experiences
hopefully to see whether there are some
commonalities there so on which we can
all agree you know and usually we always
see that there's some layer there that
we all can agree on and then kind of
there's a layer that we can't then on
the layer that we don't necessarily
agree seeing maybe it's a merit of each
other where we can actually adopt things
from each other and then I think that's
what's most important Then you mentioned
three centers but I think there's a lot
of countries that not in neither and I
think those countries that are in
neither they actually a lot of times
forgotten especially in this bigger
geopolitical discussion people like to
mention three centers and as if this is
the world but a lot of other parts of
the world at least they consume the
technology you know and actually a lot
of them have a right and would like to
participate in technology development so
for them it's very useful to come and
hear these different approaches and to
understand what's best for them and it
may not be neither of them directly it
could be some combination of elements of
all them to adapt it for their own and I
think that is also very important role
that you play. So for example when we
did last year we had our first AI
governance day at the for good summit.
So this year was the second. So the
first first year we basically brought
all these different let's say agreement
groups or convening groups on AI
together to share you know we said okay
what does G77 do you know what does G20
do what does the what's called lechley
process you know what what is been what
has been discussed there day know what
does European Union think you know what
does United States of America think what
does China think and then kind of within
that kind of create that platform for
all of them share and and even
understand each other because a lot of
times when we say and what you said that
we kind of oversimplify as well let's be
open you know we kind of see them see
those frameworks in specific blocks and
when we kind of put that in a bit of a
stereotypical environment but when you
start in wrapping you start
understanding some of the more reasons
more nuanced reasons sometimes be beyond
that and that's where and then you allow
to see the results allow everyone to
brag about results those different
approaches achieve and then you say okay
let's kind of choose for ourselves
what's best you know and that's kind
maybe go through these cycles and maybe
at some point we'll start converging a
little bit but I think but that's kind
of where I think the idea of ours we we
don't seek to have a kind of global one
framework that everyone will have to buy
to we actually try to encourage learning
between the different frameworks and
different ecosystems ecosystems
different groups or different country
groups or countries to say so that
everyone kind of has that information to
be able to choose for themselves what
works best for them for them
Uh I think that's uh fantastic. One
question I had is that AI at least that
I I'm based here in Washington. The
discussion of AI has become more about
national security or geopolitical
perspective that you know either you
know we you're going to be in one side
or another with the ecosystem there's
you know restrictions on chip exports
and things like that. Did you I mean I
know there was the GSM, CDMMA, the 4G
etc. Is there a historical precedence of
something like this in ITU's history? I
mean this is again you know better and
then how does one deal with something
like that? I mean this historical
presence precedence of differences is
like even if you look at the history the
reason why rail railway rails are
different with has to do with the
national security in some circumstances
and also that enemy couldn't couldn't
get the same the same train on your
rails when they when they invade you you
know so I think this technology linked
with the national security and
technological decisions something
intentionally being being not to
integrate but to separate you know this
is not new you know then these other
aspects So as you mentioned you said you
know CDMMA versus GSM uh GSM kind of
standards but even on the broadcasting
when we started with digital
broadcasting and and before you know we
have like a different standards that
were not that easy to to uh to let's say
combine so this is kind of difference
diversion technological developments are
not new by themselves I think now
they're so visible because the digital
technology and AI is so pervasive you
know because it's not as it's not a part
it's not a slideshow is not a part of
our lives. This is our lives, you know,
we kind of live that way. So I think in
a way what we try to do though in always
we kind of go like look we are kind of
global organization. We're not a club of
like-minded countries. There are a lot
of like-minded country clubs. We're not
like a group of like specific industry
group that wants to kind of promote
specific technology. We're the place
when people come to talk in with
everyone including those they would not
never agree with, you So that's kind of
when they come to the UN, you know,
because this is a place when you totally
disagree, you can still come and you can
still talk and and that's what I use res
160 years was, you know, as I sometimes
say, even when you fight and you're at
war, you still need to have a way to
call each other, you know, so to to stop
that war and say like, look, maybe let's
stop it now, you know. So I think now
with AI, I think that's again this is of
course, you know, national security
matters, geopolitical matters which we
as a don't kind of pine on. This is for
every country to have. But we say can we
in all these still agree and as I
mentioned before on some common
principles are there still commonalities
and the only commonality can be for
example that we still would like to be
learning from each other or then the
commonality can be that actually some of
the systems need to work to each other
with each other for example like
internet no we can have a very different
approaches what is the freedom of speech
in different parts of the world and
what's the boundary between freedom of
speech and public security but we all
agree more or less that we all want that
message to go from one point to another
you know so and that was always say to
you kind of resound you know that we
don't kind of say which kind of value
system at the different ends would be
but we say that whatever it is we still
enable people to kind of communicate and
then through once they start
communicating then they can discuss
value systems and everything else on top
of that and maybe sometimes and
sometimes they actually agree quite a
bit now in IU for example discussion on
human rights becoming like rather
prominent topic that in the past it
wasn't you know where people now see how
to integrate human right aspect in
technology so but that's because the
baseline here is that we need to agree
like I have another example on submarine
cables that we started working since
last year very actively on operational
part and because we saw a lot of breaks
and again other people saw that is a
huge political issue in national
security issue and again for it to may
be able to work with that we had to take
it at a notch at the level where it's
agree it's a joint agreement that we all
need that ecosystem of submarine cables
to work because that's how the digital
world is connected And that's why we now
have international advisory board in sum
criminal resilience that has everyone
all the geopolitical powers I mentioned
before has in that body together and
actually for example we had this so
called Abuja declaration they all
managed to agree on it I mean on the
principal level and that's why people
sometimes are disappointed that UN maybe
is not concrete enough but you see
that's kind of that's the purpose of
these frameworks and this ecosystem to
agree what we can agree and then kind of
slowly see where the limit is. So for
now and and now kind of what happens
here and I think I'm back back to this
the newer the technology is and the
faster the technology moves everyone
wants to kind of capture the benefits of
it and see see the value of this and
that's natural you know there are of
course some because the digital
technology is so pervasive people have
some concerns you know what that could
mean for their lives if there are some
threats or or or some sort of resilience
issues in that technology so all is very
normal but I think from a two
perspective we always say guys. But we
all need to have the technology. We all
need to agree how it will be kind of
working together. We need to agree how
it will be interoperate. So at least
let's figure out how many how far we can
go with that before before there's a
divergence happens.
So you bring at least some semblance of
commonality that people can agree on
because we all whether it is uh
telecommunications, telegraph or the
internet or AI, we all need it. So I
think uh that's a great point. You very
uh minutely touched on this and I want
our listeners to understand. You talked
about undersea cables.
such a vast amount of what the data even
you and I talking right now on the uh on
this podcast is driven by uh the
undersea cables right Thomas and why
this is so critical that people and
obviously in the past year and so we've
seen some issues that have popped up so
itu is trying to create some consensus
on that too right Tomas
>> no exactly look this is like a the the
conversation between you and I Now
definitely are going through submarine
cables because it's first of all
different continents and even if but
even if we were in the same uh you know
same continent you know it's likely that
somewhere somewhere something is is
being transmitted actually 99% of the
international traffic goes through the
submarine cables you know and when the
even signal goes up to satellites still
goes back to the submarine cable to be
transmitted. So this is crucial
infrastructure you know in one hand is a
lot of it 1.7 million kilometers if you
think but in the other hand it's just a
few just a little because it's around
500 of those cables you know around the
world
>> and they do you know like sometimes you
know I show the people I don't think I
have around me now but I show the people
how that cable looks like you know it's
not like it's not much larger than my
kind of small finger you know so and
that's kind of this is like an
infrastructure that we rely on you know
so
>> and they break you know there's around
200 let's say breaks a year you know
that we we experience you know like
around the world so this is something
that we need to kind of take care of
know so now as a as a as a community
because sometimes that cable may break
in place a in let's say you know
Mediterranean or red sea and it can
impact a lot of communication between
the continents you know and sometimes
you know like between Europe and Asia
but also then because of other things
the different continents as well you
know so this kind of this is really have
and and specify the effect so that the
fact that cable broke in your in your
territory doesn't mean it's only you are
affected you know like actually big
parts of the world can be so we brought
that community together we brought an
expert it's actually 40 experts plus two
chairs which is Nigerian minister of
digital technologies and regulator of
communications from Portugal that
they're chairing this you know and as I
said very kind of very inclusive way
because it's also governments from all
the parts of the world the private
sector and others to kind of agree on
the common rules of the world. And we
said like what are the best what
practices do we need to instill to make
sure that those cables can be deployed
fast repaired fast you know the permits
can be given fast because some of the
things sound very technical like getting
permit to repair but if that permit to
repair takes three months to get you
know imagine how much disruption you
have to experience you know because that
cable is not working for that three
months you know so so these things you
know and because there's only a few of
them if if six or six of them they are
cut and that's not uncommon by the way
you know out of that how much and
especially in strategic locations how
much of that is impacted you know we're
also looking in the better monitoring
basically knowing the data data is
always a challenge so so we can take
better actions and also we're still
looking at this wide spots you know so
the countries or territories especially
that still applies to small island
developing states where that uh uh that
connectivity some cable connectivity may
not be still available you know so how
to plug that and we're kind of having
working groups that are looking into
that so I think idea is to really
progress on that we doesn't come there
as a newcomer. We we had a
standardization side of it where we've
been developing cable standards on the
technology side but now and most of the
cables are based on our technology
standardized technology but now we kind
of moving to more kind of understanding
operational and policy side and we have
a great partners there in the name of
international uh cable protection
commission which is an industry body
that also partnering with us on that to
make sure that we have a very strong
industry perspective on this
>> well for folks uh so that they can call
relate why uh we're talking about this
is just so that you understand when you
put uh a prompt into chat GPT there's a
good uh chance it's going through some
of those cables that Thomas is uh
talking about u Thomas you spoken at
length uh and with your past about
making sure that AI and digital benefits
everybody talked about AI equity you
work in a place like Pulao and other
places etc. And you talked just now
about hey there are people who don't
want to be in these three blocks or
whatever we groupings we call these. How
do we make sure or how is itu making
sure whether it is the Pacific Islander
nations their culture remember in uh AI
is driven by the internet is 70% English
western oriented uh culture how do we
make sure that firstly they see the
benefits of uh AI and also their
language their culture their history in
many cases going back hundreds and
thousands of years also uh are part of
this dialogue.
>> Thank you Sanj. That's indeed one one of
the most rewarding parts of my career
was spending the time in places like
Wanoat or British Virgin Islands where
you can see how the technology brings uh
brings benefit to the people very in a
very direct way and actually the more
remote the place is the more the more
impact of technology can be felt very
fast you know once the technology
happens you know because you know the
markets are opened you know education
information is opened in in our ability
to reach out the world really kind of
makes a huge transformational
difference. So it's not only about
technology you know for us we see the
technology sometimes you know like in
visit in Washington DC or like me in
Geneva see technology as a kind of
improving the way we do you know but in
some cases when technology when
submarine cable and connectivity or or
general internet connectivity is first
introduced in some of the remote
communities this is like
transformational for the community you
know in both good way because it can
open more markets new information all
others but also new risks way because it
can open up the uh it can open up new
risks that their community hasn't dealt
with before you know like we you know
like I'm saying for for some of the C
for example the if this internet was a
transition from television or radio you
know and others if you look at the
remote island in Vanovato you know that
could be this that when when the teles
center was built and internet came there
that could be the first time the certain
kind of information came in full stop
you know so and that's kind of creates
new challenges by itself but there is
this huge opportunity piece and I think
that opportunity piece as I mentioned
the bigger the more remote and and less
the place the more opportunity it has it
gets when when this thing open like we
saw that with the mobile phones mobile
payments and others you know like for us
mobile phone in many ways was like okay
additional technology a lot of a lot of
people was access to finance you know
like for because of the mobile finance
or access to education or access to
market prices you know information so so
the same with AI you know so I think you
know the less developed for example your
educational system is then maybe more
benefit AI can bring and actually it's
interesting we have some statistics that
in Europe for example people more fear
of AI around two-thirds fear of a job
losses and other things whereas if you
look at low or mid to middle inome
countries they actually more people are
positive you know twothirds of them say
no actually AI will probably improve our
lives you know and and and sometimes
more even than two-thirds but you know
improve our lives you know provide new
opportun you know create better jobs but
also provide new opportunities for
health and education so this is and I
call it opportunity divide which usually
goes opposite which is so for some
reason goes opposite way than than other
divides. Now coming to other devices so
means how we bring it. So this is very
multifaceted of course infrastructure
piece is still important. You we you
spoke and you explained the audience
submarine cables importance and that's
this is like it's not trivial. I mean if
you don't have infrastructure which we
take as granted all these fancy apps
will not work you know. So, so from
submarine cables to access technologies
like mobile broadband or fixed broadband
to data centers, you know, this is this
is uh you need to have an infrastructure
and you have this huge device. Still 2.6
billion of people are not connected, you
know, and in low-inccome countries
around the third people only are
connected. Imagine like if twothirds of
people in Washington DC didn't have a
phone, you know, it would be weird. No.
So, in in low-inccome countries only
third people are still uh connected. Now
if you look data centers for example
like in Africa Africa is around just
just uh short of 20% of a world's
population you know like nearly 19 I
think exact it has less than 2% of data
centers you know so it's kind of the
whole Africa you know so again if you
look so 90% of the compute data centers
are owned by from two countries you know
so you probably guess which country
those two countries are you know so you
know there's a huge divide in
infrastructure is then also divide in
innovativeness you know you have more
than 70% of I think the the the patents
are coming from two countries as well
you know so so you have that you have
those divides again on innovativeness as
well you have and then the policy divide
which is kind of interestingly it's
correlated you know because a still more
than half of the countries don't have um
the policies you know 85% don't have
regulations or strategies on AI but of
course it's correlated because if you're
not AI if you don't understand what AI
is don't have access it's difficult to
write a policy for it but at the same
time if you don't write the policy may
not be encouraging your market to
develop you know so these are the things
so now I think and then AI skills in a
broader system so I think for ATU this
is like a multistack if you will
multi-layered problem you know that we
need to resolve and we're trying to and
and and that's where being atu which
comes from digital infrastructure we're
now all the way to kind of applications
and technologies like AI is very useful
because we have that understanding of
the full ecosystem I would think you
know so That's why we tackled
infrastructure gaps. You know, we
assessed through our additional
infrastructure investment initiative
that we run with the seven multilateral
development banks that around$ 1.6
trillion US dollars are needed to invest
in infrastructure to bring
infrastructure around the world to to
the same level and we need to spend it
by 2030 and that includes data centers
includes you know functional or
meaningful we say insurance
connectivity. We'll look at the the
policy policy development and our you
know our governance day and working with
others as well of helping countries to
understand where the right policies to
bridge that policy gap. We look at the
skills gap. So we have on our flagship
AI skills coalition with more than 50
partners you know that have a different
a capabilities and now how to push those
AI skills uh to the people. So all these
different aspects from infrastructure to
skills really to kind of encourage that
development. Now what's very important
for us and that's I think again what
what shows some of initiatives that in
ideas creativity and enthusiasm is not
kind of it doesn't have the same divide
as technology sometimes you know like
because so we run these things we call
AI innovation factory where startups
pitch from all around the world no we
run these things called AI machine
learning competitions where the coders
pitch the ideas from around the world we
have these things we call robotics
challenges where the high Cool teams
from all the world compete, you know,
and program robots, you know, to tackle
real life challenges like disaster
management. And you see a lot of teams
from all around the world, you know, I
visited robotics team in Nigeria just
outskirts of Abuja, you know, like eyes
are lit up, you know, eyes are lighting
up of these kids when they when they I
would like to I would I nearly said
play, but they don't play with those
troubles because they need the same
programming as a big robot we have. They
actually resolve real life challenges
with troubles. You have these examples
for innovation factory from entrepreneur
from Ghana who uses AI to check prop
crop health you know and to kind of
address those issues. Entrepreneur from
Rwanda who does uses mobile to take
pictures and do the uh preliminary
health assessments. So you have these a
lot of ideas. So what's kind of that's
what I think concluding it here that
once you bring people tools that we have
a bit of a I a feel John responsible to
do then those ideas start bubbling up
and then all these other things that you
mentioned you know language aspects and
and and the relevance aspects starts
being resolved because those people are
resolving them for themselves you know
they don't need you to resolve those
aspects they will resolve those once
they have tools to do that
>> so empower them I think is what you're
thing and with connectivity with data
with skills um I think and it plays a
key key role uh
concluding on where we began uh Thomas
uh which is the AI for good summit
you've been uh the key force behind what
has turned into the largest uh summit uh
for AI tell our listeners I mean I was
there it was incredible
uh Just what is this summit? What are
some of the you know uh conclusions the
you know the objectives and what have
been the results that have come out of
it and the different aspects so that a
lot of them next year should participate
but it is truly a remarkable conference
where actually I got a chance to speak
to will I am but anyway that's a whole
different story. Uh so Thomas uh tell
our listeners about uh the conference
which is uh your brainchild in many ways
AI for good.
>> Thank you Sanji. So this is actually a
product of a lot of great people in ATU
and actually started and I have to I had
to confess before I joined ATU this time
you know so this means you know this the
first iteration was already in 2017 and
some brave people at that time were very
forightful said let's start building it
and of course then current secret and
you know me being part of the team I
think it was really proud moments to
being able to take that as well with the
team and and actually make that asset
even bigger and greater you know and it
this because I think we were with this
development we were in the right time
when the AI interest exploded we already
had a very functioning you know AI for
good summit and then suddenly gotten
everyone's attention you know and what I
think the few things are important and I
say why people should be there first of
all it is the largest uh UN event on
artificial intelligence and I think
that's so we have 53 uh UN partners
there it's not just a U event it's
actually UN wide 53 partners event that
all come together all share ideas all
bring their own perspectives and that's
very important because I think for AI
it's also the event where you start
seeing how the power of AI expresses
itself not in a technology itself but in
its application different areas you see
people talking about AI in agriculture
we just launched initiative on that you
know you see people talking about AI in
health people looking at the transport
how impacts transport and you probably
saw in our exhibition you know some of
the new passenger drones you know so you
know people thinking about jobs you know
we have international labor organization
really looking into that how AI would
impact jobs and you know how we need to
adjust in that people thinking about
ethical things so it's really the broad
scope it all is united because it's UN
conference through that of course lens
for good you know that means how do we
leverage that to really improve our
lives improve the prosperity improve the
sustainability make our lives better you
know end of the day you know like both
our individual lives our countries our
countries better so that but this angle
is very diverse now it also means that
it comes We have a huge participation
you know so we had for UN at least we
had 11,000 people this year physically
we had 10,000 people connected online
that's I think double from last year
triple from the year before so there's
still an exponential growth that's why
encouragement already to book your
tickets early you know so that you get
it get there get in place but also it's
different stakeholder groups we had 169
countries represented you know we had
you know we had around 115
minister deputy minister head regulator
level, you know, so really kind of
decision makers, you know, we had, you
know, different stakeholder groups,
academia, private sector, you know, like
really from different parts of the world
to really engaging there, you know, and
then you have through the program, you
look at through different lenses, you
look through governance lens, you look
from standardization lens, you look from
the solutions lens, and then you
actually experience actual solutions in
our exhibition floor, you know, like
brain machine interfaces, you know, like
this, you know, drones, like specific
specific other applications,
applications
down in details like telecom networks
you know that you can see AI making
difference. So saying this is the event
for everyone who wants to understand how
not just to kind of how to bring that
technology together the policy and then
kind of make an impact for the world at
large and I think anyone who kind of
feels that about AI and any new emerging
technology you know we had a quantum
track since this year and we probably
will continue next or we're having a bit
of a space discussions as well should be
there should be there with us next year
is already the dates so 7 to 10 of uh 7
to the 10th of July next year here in
Geneva in Plexo, the biggest conference
venue in Geneva. So we hope to see you
here and we hope to really progress that
dialogue with everyone and progress that
work with everyone to make sure that AI
as you rightly kind of few times
referred is not just a kind of this
fancy technology that we can talk about
few countries in the world that can
benefit of that but AI power the
positive power is really felt around the
world by everyone.
>> Yeah. And uh for our listeners, I have
to say it was exceptionally
well-managed. Geneva is a great city. Uh
and Pexpo is wow. It's right next to the
airport. But uh they, you know, this was
very different. I've been to a lot of AI
conferences, but really truly AI for
good. Tomas. So Thomas, thank you really
for joining us on the regulating AI
podcast. you know your work at ITU with
your cross uh regional especially your
work across the world your experiences
uh and you know explaining why standards
are important why it is important and
let's uh focus on what brings us
together not keeps us separate I think
uh has been exceptionally helpful and
also talking about AI for good and for
our listeners just remember that AI
regulation isn't just about constraining
technology technology. It's about
ensuring that artificial intelligence
truly serves all of humanity from the
smallest island states to the largest
economies and that's what Thomas has
been talking about. This is the
regulating AI podcast. I'm your host
Sanjay Puri and we'll see you next time
as we continue exploring how we shape
responsible AI governance for our global
future. Thomas, this was fantastic. Uh
really uh thank you for taking the time.
This was great. Appreciate it.
>> Thank you Sanji. Thank you. It was
really a pleasure for me to be part of
this. Thank you very much.
