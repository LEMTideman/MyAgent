if we wait until one is at deployment of
the technology in the workforce setting
or or or or frankly uh in in any of the
places that we engage engaging with a
chatbot to manage your uh your online
bank account if we wait for those
moments it's too late we spend a lot of
time on AI risk and fear and I'm sure we
may be able to to to get to that uh but
but on the other side of risk is reward
and I want to I want to spend my time uh
building Frameworks of AI Rewards uh in
our society we should not operate from a
position of fear here this is a way for
us frankly to to drive it even a greater
Equity than we had before what we need
to do is one name the the problem make
sure that there's representation in
these rooms uh that is one of the
reasons I am behind something like the
lift AI uh act and and then three having
broad goals around inclusion
welcome to the regulating AI podcast
join host Sanjay pury as he explores the
dynamic and developing world of
artificial intelligence governance each
episode features deep Dives with global
leaders at the Forefront of regulating
AI responsibly tackling the challenges
using AI can bring about head-on and
enabling balance without hindering
[Music]
Innovation welcome to regulating AI the
podcast that brings Global diverse
voices together to discuss fair and
responsible AI regulation worldwide I'm
your host Sanjay Puri and today we are
thrilled to have Congressman Gabe U
joining us Congressman U has dedicated
most of his career to public service in
Rhode Island and Washington DC including
roles in the Biden White House and as
director of public engagement for former
Rhode Island Governor China randoo as a
member of the House committee on science
space and Technology he's been actively
involved in shaping AI policy
today we'll explore his views on air
regulation education and the future of
technology and governance Congressman
welcome to the regulating AI podcast
thank you for having me on I'm grateful
to have an opportunity to uh share some
thoughts on what I know is such an
important topic uh to so many uh across
the world uh as it evolves uh and and
finds its way into every part of our
Lives wonderful uh Congressman we have a
global audience uh you know policy
makers think tanks
entrepreneurs uh people who are just
fascinated by AI so for them uh can you
just tell them a little bit about your
journey into public service service and
how uh your work has led you to focus on
uh artificial intelligence policy well
you know I've had an opportunity to work
uh at the heights of government uh in my
short uh Public Service uh career
actually it's long at this point uh
though I'm 36 years old I've had the
opportunity to work for two presidents
of the United States uh at the white
house uh working for the Obama White
House as a junior staff member in the
office of intergovernmental Affairs then
uh between uh my White House St worked
for uh gin randoo the US Secretary of
Commerce uh who as you know is playing a
major role uh in AI but before then uh
we were uh at service for our home state
where I worked with her uh and for her
on her senior staff managing a lot of
our external relationships with the
cross uh section of partners that you
have uh business labor unions um
Chambers of Commerce um Municipal
leaders Mayors uh town councils and a
whole Spate of of of folks interested in
the business of government uh and the
relationships needed to carry uh that
business out and then I served in the
Biden white house uh worked on the
president's campaign and started from
day one on January 20th uh
2021 uh and uh served until uh April uh
of 2023 as the Special Assistant to the
president and deputy director of The
White House Office of intergovernmental
Affairs where I helped provide uh the
perspective of state and local leaders
and then supported those state and local
leaders uh across uh the country country
on good days and bad bad days uh
emergencies uh Wildfire mass shooting uh
hurricane uh building collapse you name
it and on good days catalyzing the
Investments of the administration uh in
uh people and places uh so that was
through historic legislation on
infrastructure climate change and the
like but I also had the opportunity to
work on uh the uh support of a framework
for an AI Bill of Rights for state and
local uh governments to uh take up so in
that wide experience and and having the
opportunity to work with state and local
leaders uh and that uh proximity to
making government function uh making
government uh respond to crisis prepare
for crisis and then that exposure to AI
via that Bill Bill of Rights framework I
got to uh to be in interested in what we
will do with one of these uh most
disruptive uh and and uh meaningful
technologies that we will have in our
lifetimes and so uh that's why when I
got to Congress uh I dug in and so as a
result of my service on the science
space and Technology committee I have a
front row seat uh to uh the the uh
beginnings of the work uh to make
government uh resp respond and engage AI
accordingly oh that's uh fantastic you
had such a wide uh exposure at the local
government level at the federal
government level and even working across
with business so I think that's uh very
very helpful but Congressman you've been
a a very strong advocate for AI literacy
particularly for young students why do
you believe it's crucial to start AI
education at the K12 level well I I
believe that the future is now we are in
a moment uh where the speed of
Technology the speed of innovation is
such that if we wait until one is at the
age of you know deep uh uh deployment of
the technology and the workforce setting
or or or or frankly uh in in any of the
places that we engage I think about you
know uh engaging with a chatbot to
manage your uh your online bank account
if we wait for those moments this too
late when the internet uh came along
right I sound like an old man when I say
that but I've lived in a pre- intern uh
in the classroom world and a post
internet in the classroom world and it
was never one course it was never uh
something that was compartmentalized and
segmented to a particular part of
learning rather I remember learning
research skills learning how uh to uh
develop uh complimentary
presentations uh of of information uh
using the tools of of the worldwide web
and we must uh do the same as it relates
to AI when I worked for the governor of
Rhode Island I helped uh roll out a
program called computer science for
Rhode Island uh bringing forth computer
science skills to those from
kindergarten right because the basics
the nuts and bolts the mathematical and
uh and uh other uh capabilities that you
need the reasoning on computer science
those elements can be taught to a
four-year-old to a 5-year-old and
similar to AI we know that those
elements uh uh will be uh present in so
many parts of our Lives we will change
the way that we learn right we need to
learn for understanding and so my focus
uh here on on on AI literacy is about
making sure that those who are equipped
uh with the tools uh of curriculum of
structure can then make sure that our
youngest uh from K to 12 are prepared uh
to engage uh thoroughly uh you know as
as the technology evolves and and moves
forward well that's uh great so as you
said the future is now and equiping our
youngest of generation with all the
skills skills that are necessary for
this transformative technology um
Congressman the bipartisan lift uh AI
act has gained tremendous support can
you share with our audience the main
objectives of this bill and how do you
foresee it impacting education in the US
yeah so the the full title uh is
literacy and future Technologies uh a
artificial intelligence act and and that
that is the goal is literacy and you
know where this fits in in in the realm
of the the educational experience is to
make sure that uh the professional
development that is necessary for our
our our school leaders are there that
are institutions of Higher Learning
which will serve as partners uh as a
vehicle for the National Science
foundation's funding to go to those
institutions of Higher Learning to go to
the appropriate nonprofits to help in
the development of the the the the uh
the of the lesson planning that is
necessary to then get into the classroom
and so where this fits in right right
now in the United States House of
Representatives uh we are being
proactive on several fronts making sure
that there is there are Frameworks for
learnings around uh around AI so this
bill fits into a broader package of
setting a ground level of foundational
uh understanding for the these emerging
uh uh opportunities and making sure that
AI is not something that is an
afterthought and so the bill is
bipartisan because that's what it should
be it should be because the the AI
doesn't know whether we're Democrats or
Republicans unless we feed it those
queries right and so uh the the the you
know premise here with my colleague Tom
uh Cain from New Jersey is that we want
to uh be very uh uh focused not overly
aggressive but focused in where we may
be able to make impacts uh in the near
term no I think uh your point is
absolutely right uh and you are working
with the NSF in get the bill makes uh
reference to the NSF working with some
of these uh educational institutions uh
Congressman exactly and the NSF has a
vehicle knowing that it is a home uh of
of innovation that it it's a place where
naturally in our system uh the the
research uh capacities the learnings
from the implementation of something uh
like this can then be translated across
uh our country in a meaningful way yes
um we had the director of the NSF on our
uh podcast some time back and he did
talk uh quite a bit about this uh
program uh Congressman uh you know you
talked about uh your work at the
intersection of federal and local
government how do you see uh AI
impacting local governance uh and policy
implementation everybody talks about the
federal stuff but you have a very unique
window having work on the local side on
the federal side so you get a a dual
window what is your perspective on the
use of Pi at the local level well I
think there's a multitude right you
think about the issue of resilience and
uh Coastal resilience I'm from Rhode
Island climate change is already
impacting us but being able to again uh
have that pattern recognition to have
the data sets of historical floods and
storm systems for local planning that's
a a remarkable capacity that would take
time uh that that would take up
resources but that can make every
Community resilient to the impacts of
climate change you think about housing
and being able to understand um you know
residential patterns to understand what
uh zoning laws uh have certain impacts
on density to to be able to
again you know deploy the uh the uh
volume of data that's necessary in order
to help policy makers uh execute
decisions that are uh both predictive in
nature and are are also verifiable and
and testable uh as opposed to
policymaking that is uh you know driven
by more arbitrary politics right that
that can help local government uh when
you think about all of the you know go
one step of government up to the state
level right one of the biggest
expenditures in every state is the
deping on Healthcare so when you think
about uh what we may be able to do in
terms of addressing certain populations
that are for example heavy users of
certain uh social services and and US
routing them to interventions that are
uh more appropriate that lead to better
outcomes right um You can see similar
when it it comes to you know managing uh
the the behavior of traffic patterns uh
and and and navigating roadways um when
it comes to issues like uh helping
people uh manage their debt and fi
financial assistance knowing that you
know people with certain spending habits
and patterns uh and uh you know
deploying you know debt relief services
that help uh people in a reasonable way
so that they can accumulate wealth so
when you you look across the Spectrum uh
the the access to the trolles of of data
and patterns of human behavior and being
predictive about where uh to to to
intervene and where what the benefits of
that that is that's the power here and
that's what you know we spend a lot of
time on AI risk and fear and I'm sure we
may be able to to to get to that uh but
but on the other side of risk is reward
and I want to I want to spend my time
building Frameworks of AI rewards uh in
our society no I think uh you make a
good point U Congressman that there is
some tremendous opportunities you talked
about climate change climate resiliency
you talked about tra you talked about
you know uh education so lots of
opportunities at a local governance
level is what you're saying uh that AI
could lead to um and obviously as you
said there are risks um uh in there now
uh Congressman when you were at the
White House you worked on several
National crisises and you kind of
alluded uh earlier to this uh how do you
see AI playing a role in crisis
management moving forward well you know
certainly on weather that is probably
the the at the the shortest path use
especially when you look at lot of
historical information that we were able
to suisee right now as we sit here
recording this there's a hurricane about
to hit uh Florida uh and and we are
thinking about the people there and
we're hopeful that that storm gets
weakened and that the impacts on on the
lives of so many uh are are minimal but
I I say that knowing that
I have been able to see hurricane
Seasons flood Seasons deep winter
uh and using you know our our knowledge
uh of of the historical uh to to predict
impacts and and then lead that lead to
Greater preparation for local leaders
that's significant and so uh you know
that that is is probably the highest uh
order use uh that that I I could see
from a disaster uh standpoint but you
know the the other things that are are
pretty valuable when you you think about
um um you know predicting uh uh behavior
and and also uh giving you know a
historical background is that my
experience when you respond uh to to
these storms when you respond to these
instance people are always seeking
information man on the street right who
who interacts and so you could see high
level functions of people being in
situations of crisis
and being able to survey possible
solutions through through the tech right
you could you could see someone you know
experiencing um you know a system of a
deep freeze uh and needing to seek out
uh solutions to address a problem in
their home to uh contact uh uh the
appropriate authorities the whole range
of problem identification and Analysis
changes and the interventions and who's
providing that intervention uh uh
changes as well so that's that's uh a
you know from a disaster standpoint a
huge opportunity so uh you know as you
said identifying the problem and how do
you respond uh some tremendous
opportunities uh uh that exist
especially in a disaster crisis
perspective uh Congressman at a recent
hearing you had question uh nist
director Dr locaso about funding for the
AI safety Institute can you uh elaborate
for our audience the importance of this
institute and how does it fit into the
broader landscape of AI regulation well
it is incredibly important for us to
stand up uh an AI uh safety Institute
you know out of uh nist uh out of the US
Department of Commerce is a bold step
towards addressing what you know is is
one of the the most prominent challenges
with with AI and it's it's the
mitigation of risk uh of making sure
that uh whether it's it's dealing with
malign actors or uh it's dealing uh with
uh the the you know the the the range of
companies uh and and private sector
actors who are engaged here in making
sure that we have things like uh the
elimination of Al rmic bias and and uh
and uh you know when you remove uh human
capacities are we uh unleashing the best
of ourselves or the worst of ourselves
through the large language models and
the training that the AI is going
through so having a unit of government
focused here is is is important and this
is why I I I was so uh insistent on
talking about funding levels because my
colleagues on the other side of the
aisle for those uh across the globe my
uh my colleagues who are uh you know
Republicans I am a Democrat uh have some
uh you know statutory Cuts uh to the
budget to the Appropriations that would
impact the ability of the safety
Institute to get the work done uh to uh
address all of the the the challenges
and opportunities that we face and so uh
the my Republican friends have uh
budgets that want to cut uh something
that is just getting off the ground and
and and not providing for success of
this uh of this institute so I I will
continue to Har we need the federal
resources uh to be uh not only uh
responsive but to get ahead because we
know that our partners uh especially in
the EU have have you know establish
really strong regulatory Frameworks I
mean I may disagree on on how they uh
carried out but we have philosophical
American and European differences and
and and uh that said we have to invest
the resources I I don't want us to be
subject entirely to the big
companies dictating how this should
proceed I don't want to inhibit
Innovation that's not what we want to do
but we want to be prepared and as
Government your number one one essential
responsibility is to be there uh for
when people need you and so what the
safety Institute does is it provides
that Mantra government being there uh on
the Forefront approximate to to to
Solutions and mitigating uh uh risks and
challenges I think you made an important
point that we need to make sure the
guard rails are there we need Innovation
but we don't want large companies to
dominate uh and make sure the safety
Institute which which is just getting
started as you said Congressman has the
resources uh that are needed uh
Congressman talking about safety uh AI
has the potential to you know exacerbate
uh inequalities if it is not handled
carefully you talked briefly about that
how can regulation help ensure that AI
benefits all communities not just a
select few yes and this is this is the
transparency uh the openness about uh
particular models about uh about
algorithms about how information is
generated and who is usually left out
are are the people who aren't
represented in the rooms of power and
that can be translated to technology uh
and it's not a function of can be it has
been there have been studies already
showing uh the the the uh the difference
uh uh of impacts uh of you know relative
to uh to credit scores uh being the uh
deployed for predictions on you know
mortgages being provided rents uh uh and
apartments being offered there have been
uh there's been bias on the public
health uh standpoint uh where you know
the the representation in data sets of
black people of people of color uh is is
less than that of of other communi so
you know we should not operate from a
position of fear here this is a way for
us frankly to to drive at even a greater
Equity than we had before and so what we
need to do is one name the the problem
right and you know I think again problem
identification is how you you get to to
to solution right name the problem make
sure that there's representation in
these rooms uh that is one of the
reasons I am behind something like the
lift AI uh act because when we open up
access to education and Pathways and
people serving uh and and working in
roles they will bring their life lives
perspectives to the table right so
having the right people around the table
and and then three having broad goals
around uh around inclusion right because
we you know I think about the public
health benefits uh so much your ability
to uh detect uh you know rare diseases
diseases that affect uh certain
communities your ability uh to to
address uh you know learning challenges
issues that you see patterns uh you know
of behavior behind there is so much
potential but it starts from a place of
of being deeply
intentional and sometimes you know Tech
is seen as a great equalizer uh but it
can only be that way uh if we name it if
we are purposeful if our steps are
ordered towards inclusion uh at every
juncture uh being de deeply intentional
I think uh Congressman that's a great uh
important Point uh it's a great
equalizer but we need to be deeply
intentional and
transparent um finally Congressman
there's a concern over Aid driven
misinformation and its impact on our
democracy
you know whether it's non-state actors
foreign actors internal whatever how do
you think and we we have an election
coming up uh pretty soon uh how do you
think regulations can address this issue
yes I look I I believe this is one of
our biggest threats uh this year is is
Miss and disinfo um and it's a function
of you know broader attack on truth it's
nothing new in this world we've always
had uh very degrees of of uh of uh of of
tabloid of speculation of uh of of
falsehood being propagated uh around uh
critical moments however this time is
unique uh it's Unique because of the
speed uh the speed with with which
information moves and so look I think
you can do some work on the legislative
side calling uh for uh truth and
advertising uh whole holding uh
responsible the platforms uh for as we
deploy information making sure uh that
that as uh you know the these these
large language models are uh you know
providing responses to uh queries uh
about election day about polling
places about information that they've
heard from the the the you know the n
um aligned sources the unbiased sources
that that should be there that there is
verification and partnership partnership
with local election officials
partnership uh with uh the good you know
good actors who are centers of providing
um of of providing unbiased information
there are lots of those people and so I
I I hope there is a uh it there's a
broad set of Partnerships and uh
attempts
to provide a clearing house and also
blocking uh and the lowquality sources
uh from uh the the results and the
queries that people put forward you know
it is going to be obviously a a rough uh
period uh given where we are now uh
where people are going to question
everything
however the best thing that we can do
the best thing we can do is is isolate
uh the the noise uh the the the rabble
rousing focus on
objectivity there's obviously a lot of
room for opinion uh let that space exist
but but make sure that that we have
clear alignment on on the concepts of
truth of facts of what uh has been not
what uh someone's says could be and so
that is is ultimately what what we have
to do and that's going to require a lot
of people to be in this together uh but
uh you know I have a great confidence uh
in our capacity to to have a very uh
healthy uh Democratic exercise uh this
November and uh and then we can build on
these great tools on AI uh so that we
can have it be part of us fully
realizing our democratic values
important points as you said isolate uh
some of the noise uh look at objective
uh information and then post our
election find some uh opportunities for
these tools to really uh give us the
benefits uh that it can um you know
thank you Congressman you for sharing
your insights on AI regulation and
education you know your work on the
lifti ACT and your commitment to
responsib AI development are crucial you
know as we navigate this rapidly
evolving technological landscape and to
our listeners remember that shaping the
future of AI is a collective effort as
Congressman said requiring engagement
from policy makers Educators industry
leaders and citizens alike join us next
time on regulating AI as we continue to
explore the challenges and opportunities
in creating a fair and responsible AI
driven World until then stay curious and
stay informed Congressman thank you so
much this was very helpful your
perspective and your work on education
the LIF AI act your work in the
community local and federal because we
all talk about big stuff but it's uh in
many cases it's the little stuff uh also
that matters climate resiliency disaster
recovery so thank you so much for being
on the podcast it's the honor to be on
and and let's keep going together
absolutely thank you
