one of the things that I find
fascinating is that so few people seem
to understand the dynamic that is at
play when they access a website for free
or download an app for free they think
it's for free but really they're paying
for it with their data I think a lot of
people do not appreciate that and don't
realize
that welcome to the regulating AI
podcast join host Sanjay pury as he
explores the dynamic and developing
world of artificial intelligence
governance each episode features deep
Dives with global leaders at the
Forefront of regulating AI responsibly
tackling the challenges using AI can
bring about head-on and enabling balance
without hindering
[Music]
Innovation welcome to regulating AI the
podcast that brings together diverse
Global voices to discuss fair and
responsible AI regulation worldwide I'm
your host Sanjay Puri and today we are
thrilled to have two distinguished
guests from the state of Vermont who are
the Forefront of AI and data privacy
legislation joining us are attorney
general charity Ray Clark and Vermont
state representative Monique Priestley
attorney general Clark has been with the
Vermont Attorney General's office since
2014 serving in various roles including
chief of staff and representative prly
brings over two decades of Technology
experience and is the executive director
of space on Maine a nonprofit Community
workspace together they have been
instrumental in passing a stringent data
Privacy Act and working on potential AI
legislation welcome uh charity and
welcome Monique to the regulating AI
podcast thanks for having us wonderful
well we have a global audience uh our
audience is made up of uh members of
congress senate their staff Think Tank
experts uh AI enthusiasts and these are
people around the world so you able to
do something that very few people have
both of you so uh charity can you give
us an overview of Vermont's new data
Privacy Act and what prompted its
creation well this is uh this is a bill
not an act at this point because while
it passed the House and Senate the
governor did veto the bill ultimately
and it it uh failed to override in the
Senate but um of course we'll be back in
January with an even better Bill no
doubt and I'm really proud of the work
being done and really I I will say that
I think the journey that this bill has
been on is a lesson in itself of how to
pass such a bill because in its Journey
a lot of Education takes place a lot of
understanding and while the landscape
continues to change as the years pass I
think that the journey that that the
bill has been on has really um uh
activated people who learn about data
privacy and the more they understand the
more interested they are in passing a
bill like this which is what we saw in
the house um Mo'Nique sits on the
committee that voted this bill out
created this bill and then voted it out
unanimously because all the people on
there receiv received the education that
um would you know activate anybody about
data privacy and and some of the perils
and what uh State legislatures and um
potentially Congress really should be
doing so I would love to defer to to our
representative who actually wrote the
Bill and is responsible for it in
describing a little bit about it about
what it does Monique do want want to say
a little bit more I'm sure you could do
it better than I can go thank you um
yeah so we uh so this was my first term
and during our first year uh we had a a
kind of a comprehensive uh data privacy
bill um that uh Shar uh AG Clark and her
office submitted um and it was really
the first time that I had dealt with
consumer protection um laws uh and given
uh my background in Tech like it was
something that um I was trying to figure
out like what is my role kind of in the
the building and so this was an area
where I felt very comfortable with at
least like the base concepts of um of
what we were talking about and I really
wanted to take it um take kind of a role
of trying to help with like all of the
the really technical pieces of the bill
moving forward um so in over the summer
of we didn't moved the bill out of
committee in 2023 we decided to take
some more time on it um and so over the
summer um I had reached out to Senator
James um in Connecticut who had
written uh a privacy bill that that our
committee wanted to use as like a
starting point um and we had a
conversation of like uh you know why did
you do certain Provisions in this did
you take it as far as you wanted to like
what would you do if you could do it all
over again like what's your advice to me
to our committee um and so he really
helped uh connect kind of like where he
went with it uh with his privacy act as
it went forward um including things like
they added consumer health protections
and um minor youth protections which we
we started with um all of that and then
also he just connected me to this whole
network that had been helping advis the
bill and that Network just continued to
grow and so um going into 2024 in
January like it wasn't just me it wasn't
just our committee it was also experts
from around the country and around the
world that were having input on red
lines but also like lobbying efforts and
things like that so it was a it was a
real collaboration with the um Attorney
General's office as well as like
attorney generals across the United
States um other legislators law
professors Tech compliance lawyers
privacy Advocates and everything in
between wow that sounds like a very
important collaboration that you did uh
charity you had mentioned in an opinion
piece that uh this bill creat mechanisms
for data
minimization uh can you elaborate on how
this works and why is it important for
our audience well let me first say that
my office is the recipient of all the
notices people give when there has been
a security breach and the data breach
notification act or the security breach
notification Act was established in
Vermont 16 years ago I think and you
know even little Vermont we get at least
one notification a day it's a couple
really on the average a day depending on
the year here and so for many um for
many organizations and companies it's
not a matter of if it's a matter of when
so long story short is we also in
addition to those notifications receive
a lot of calls from businesses saying we
we had a breach but here's the
information we had and it's like not on
the list of things you have to report
and they're like do we really not have
to report this and we want to say
congratulations you did data
randomization no you don't have to
report it and likely your customers or
whoever else was in your database are
not having their privacy or their you
know Financial Security or physical
security compromised in any way because
you deleted the data or you didn't ask
for the data um you used the data for
the data for the reason you said you
were going to use it for and then you
got rid of it or whatever you didn't
hold data in certain places either so
really the data minimization provision
of this bill was a codification of best
practices we all should be doing and
again Mo'Nique probably can remember all
the details it was inspired by
by legislation that had already taken
place in other states so it was not
Reinventing the wheel for those um data
holders who would need to comply we
certainly wanted to make it easy for
them um but th this is just a real
Common Sense provision in my
opinion yeah so when we we started with
Connecticut but then after talking to a
number of different states um and
privacy Advocates uh it was clear that
we really needed to that we really
didn't have data minimalization um by
using the base Connecticut model um and
so by talking to um other states um
really actually like Maine and
Massachusetts we we taking a strong
stance on data minimization at the same
time that we were working on our bill so
largely we were really trying to like be
in line with those States um and then as
negotiations went forward and we were
needed basically on the Senate side they
were tending to uh have the industry
kind of um have them water down and we
weaken the bill and so uh in order to
kind of account for some of the areas
that things had been weakened um we
actually made certain areas like data
minimization stronger um and at the
towards the end we actually used uh
based that minimization piece off of
Maryland uh which instead of minimizing
the use of data once you have it it
minimizes the uh collection of data as
it comes in um so at the very roots of
the problem um when companies are
collecting data
that's
great the data Privacy Act also includes
uh specific Pro protections for
children can either of you talk about
some of these provisions and why they
are
crucial well I can talk about the
provisions that are related to social
media my office has sued meta for harms
that they perpetuated against children
with the app Instagram um and that
includes creating a a harmful app that's
addictive but also the content that
children are exposed to um and uh
unwanted contact from strangers and and
several other components so the language
of that portion of the bill was inspired
um by in part by the experience that we
had the investigation that we had in our
ultimate lawsuit against to meta and
what we've learned in the process we're
also investigating Tik Tok um who
unfortunately had some of the same ills
as Instagram so far as we can tell at
this point so it's um it's reflects that
that work that was done and I think that
it's an acknowledge what I'll tell you
something Sanji in my travels here in
Vermont this the legislative session has
ended my attention can um leave monar a
little bit more robustly and and making
my way around the state I would say that
the issue that I hear about the most is
this this issue that I sued meta you
know thank you charity for taking this
stand and I hear from parents and
teachers and and they realize you know
the the concerns are very visceral to
them um those who work with children and
of course what we know is that data is
what's fueling social media and these
issues are connected so um anyway wanted
to highlight that I think it's really
important but Monique maybe you can
speak to some of the other Provisions
too yeah definitely so there was a kind
of a two part piece to the minor
protection so in the data Privacy Act
that we were taking Connecticut as a
model they had minor Provisions um we
actually ended up swapping for Colorado
towards the end but um because that had
been continued to work on
Connecticut in those data
protections it really was getting at uh
basically just protecting people's data
and it uh it was giving heightened risk
kind of like two minor protections um
and at the same time we had kind of like
the kids code piece of things that was
going after how is data used to affect
kids um adversely um and but uh a a
critical piece here is that though those
two bills so kids code and the Privacy
Act with their minor Provisions were
moving together at the same time uh but
it was clear they could never coexist
they were kind of like um contradicting
each other uh so a lot of at towards the
end uh as far as
political navigation we had to marry
those into one comprehensive um bill and
what we did towards the end I actually
really appreciated um it's I spent three
full days of legislative Council uh to
take all of the DAT anything that had to
do with data itself uh out of the kids
code and move it over to the
comprehensive data Privacy Act where it
should be like um and then keep the kids
code piece really at like how is the
data being used to manipulate a nudge
and um keep people addicted and stuff um
but I think the the bigger lesson for me
on the data piece is that it is
attractive politically to like protect
to say we're protecting kids but every
one of every age should be afforded
privacy protections and if we're
protecting everybody we are protecting
kids um so the thing for me is like yes
we have kids protections um but we want
to make sure that no matter what age
anybody is especially even thinking
about like the most vulnerable like
elderly people who are getting love
scammed and things like that like we
need to really think about uh you know a
lot of States we're just copying each
other's privacy policies over and over
which is like how things work uh but we
need to like do the due diligence to
like think about at a fundamental level
why do we want data collected like why
are we are why are we basing our entire
world's business on data and then do we
want to be responsible with it and if we
want to be responsible with it maybe we
don't maybe we just want to make money
hopefully we want to be responsible uh
but like what is that mean and and who
does that mean and are we leaving people
out um with our policies and so that's
for me it came to like we can't leave
anybody out of any age um yeah yeah I
think you make a great Point Monique you
can't leave because as you said there
are vulnerable populations in every
segment and I'm going to come down to
that later when we talk about AI but uh
charity I made a mistake we have a
global audience I want you to tell them
what is the attorney general office
because we take it for granted that
everybody knows and I should have
upfront because they they're probably
scratching the head because you
mentioned you sued meta you're about you
want to do the same to Tik Tok so please
just a very brief idea of what AG's
office does well we're investigating Tik
Tok at this point we have Sue Tik Tok um
so the Attorney General is an elected
official in a state every state has one
although not in every state are the
elected um here in the United States and
in short where the lawyer to the state
so sometimes that means we're just you
know reading the state's contracts or
whatever we also give advice to the
legislature of course but um we can
bring lawsuits on behalf of the state
and that could look simply like you know
someone put a toxic waste dump in their
backyard and they can't do that so we
use environmental laws to Sue that
person um but in this context we're
talking about as Monique referred to a
consumer law and the consumer protection
act is a powerful act here in Vermont
and nationally um um it it's um you know
when you protect consumers you protect
the marketplace and especially in the
United States we are a capitalist
country and um the marketplace is
incredibly important so we take it
really seriously and of course that is
where I came from in the Attorney
General's office that's where I started
so I myself I'm a consumer lawyer and so
no surprise I am very passionate about
data privacy because as we know um
consumer transactions so largely take
place today online and online is fueled
by data and so it's a fundamental piece
of our current Marketplace in 2024 this
is just life but what's so um I mean
setting aside the the policy issues it's
also fascinating from many in many
respects one of the things that I find
fascinating is that so few people seem
to understand the dynamic that is at
play when they access a website for free
or download an app for free they think
it's for free but really they're paying
for it with their data I think a lot of
people do not appreciate that and don't
realize that and one of the things that
Monique and I do in our work on this
issue is we try to educate vermonter
about this fact that those of us who do
this work know to be so um fundamental
and it's really interesting to see how
surprised people are when they realize
what the dynamic is and it to me it just
speaks to the importance of appropriate
regulations because I will tell you
something that is any consumer Loy will
talk about is scams and I truly am
concerned that if we don't take
seriously the regulation of data
including deep fakes there is going to
be a destabilizing impact on the
internet economy because consumers
aren't going to trust when they buy
something when they buy a service that
it's real and so I or they're going to
be nervous to um you know share their
data because they're nervous about
getting um um becoming a victim of
identity theft and having their money
stolen or whatever and we all remember
rooc calls right and how it used to be
someone would call you and say would you
like to buy some Stakes or whatever and
you might say yes and then scam Robo
calls kind of took over and now no one
buys anything over the phone and we
don't even answer our phones I don't I
don't answer my phone I just let it go
to voicemail if I want to call the
person back I will um so I don't want
that to happen to the internet and I
always point that out to people that
when you protect consumers you protect
the marketplace too
so you raised some uh very important
points here uh charity you talked about
consumer protection uh you talked about
picking up the phones you also talked
about deep fixs and this is something
you've talked a lot about we are in an
election time in our country right now
and uh there have there have been
elections in other parts of the world
France UK Etc what uh can states do
about uh deep fakes U and you saw what
what happened uh in the primary I think
it was in uh Connecticut with President
Biden and things of that nature what are
your views on uh deep fakes as far as
the and now with AI it's so so easy for
people to produce deep fakes so charity
what what is your office doing or what
are your views on this well first I want
to make a distinction between a
legitimate company doing something that
might violate the consumer protection
act you know that would be in my case
against right they are very legitimate
um company doing something that that
we're saying in our lawsuit violates
consumer protection act in contrast to
actual criminals who are scammers and
they're trying to steal things or trick
you and that's a different category so
deep fakes I would put in that category
where people are trying to trick you in
some fashion and we I can see three
examples you gave the political example
which is critical and chilling there's
also the consumer example remember there
was a couple of people um scammers who
were trying to say oh this is Taylor
Swift or another celebrity and they're
selling this or you know give away well
that's in the consumer context in the
scam context and then of course
supposedly 90% of deep fakes are
actually non-consensual deep fake
pornography 90% is a very high number
and also disturbing that this you know
really incredible technology is being
used for this purpose is um incredibly
disappointing and sad and also it's very
very gendered because 90% of those 90%
are women the faces of women are being
used in this way um very offensive um
very upsetting and the New York Times
recently called an epidemic among teen
girls so you know I'm the first woman
elected attorney general here in Vermont
and I'm always looking through that lens
of what am I seeing that no woman has
seen before you know with through my
experience and what I can notice and so
I have really focused on deep fakes for
a number of reasons they're right you
know here in my in my wheelhouse um but
I'm I'm really concerned about um the
ways that these are being used to hurt
people um you asked me about uh the
political use of deep fakes so I want to
make sure I answer that question I
really feel at this point when PE it's
so new deep fakes are so new it's
important for people to um be educated
and know that what they're seeing might
not be real because there there are so
few regulatory guidelines in place that
are um you know helping to educate the
public and I think we saw this in New
Hampshire someone used deep fake te
technology um to make a deep fake of uh
President Biden's voice and it's
chilling but immediately it's a company
was able to say because there's also of
course a merket for uh deep fake
identifiers was able to say this is a
deep fake and that's really helpful but
educating the public the press and
individuals including voters you don't
be naive this this happens I think is
really
critical but charity is there a danger
that we become so cynical that we don't
believe anything anymore well that's
kind of relates to my point about my
concern on the about the internet
marketplace where consumers are so
cynical they don't think anything like
us with the phone like no one could sell
me anything over the phone I would never
buy it I would be like send me something
via Pony Express like I'm not buying it
so it's so ironic that we create these
incredible technological tools and then
we revert I'm literally getting a
landline installed in my house because I
don't want my kid getting a smartphone
you're going You're Going Back In Time
charity we're going back in time so
true but um one of the things uh charity
that you have mentioned is the influence
of big Tech during your whole
legislative process that it was really
really hard maybe both of you can
address this for our audience for other
attorney generals and other Governors
who listen in who are trying to do some
of these things as to what are the
lessons learned by both of you during
this whole process and you talked a lot
about it I've read some of the things
youve said Char and and Mo'Nique wrote
an oped about this I don't know Monique
if you want to say a little bit about
your observation being the person who
was sort of in the thick of it being
lobbied yeah no problem um yeah lots of
articles about this um so yeah so I mean
I think the thing uh is that first like
we wanted like I wanted to have
conversations with lobbyists on all
sides of the issue so typically like
some legislators will not just won't
talk to lobbyists um because they don't
want to be persuaded and manipulated um
in in my case I want to hear both sides
so um I what we did um so that our
committee members wouldn't be inundated
with manipulation and persuasion and
tactics is that we basically everybody
would defer and say you have to talk to
manik about this like I'm not talking
about it so it meant that I had a flood
of funold lobbyists coming my way um and
what I do so I sat down with any any
lobbyists and any lobbyist clients that
wanted to talk um and I started forming
like the same questions over and over I
just turned into like more or less a
form email that I would say I need you
to answer these six questions uh once
you answer those questions or you don't
but you at least attemp
have a good faith uh you know response
to it then we'll sit down and we'll talk
through it and some of those questions
which um I'm actually putting together
basically an anti- uh lobbying uh
Playbook with some national groups uh so
any of the things I mentioned that
anybody who's listening wants to go over
I'm putting into a resource so that
would be the questions would be
something like you say you have a
problem with this bill um what are the
business cases that you are saying this
bill interrupts um what is the exact
verbage uh in line uh that you are
saying does this uh how what would you
propose that we change this line to and
then really actually asked them to talk
through the ramifications of the change
they were proposing um is if they were
asking for an exemption and I wanted to
know like prove that other states have
done this exemption and if uh if they
haven't then probably are a luck but if
they have let's talk about it
um and so that so that was a big chunk
of things but when we were in our
committee um another thing that we did
is so I was uh anytime a lobbyist had a
question I would go to like 20 different
people and I would uh from all sides of
the spectrum of like Pro do pro do the
regulations privacy advoc advocacy to
the compliance lawyers who actually
trying to help the tech companies
navigate this and so I could and
everything in between so I could get a
good spectrum of what's realistic um and
so I would you know have calls with
people offline and say they want this
change what do this change actually do
like tell me the worst and best case
that this does um and so it's constant
education on me and then I was redlining
uh the documents myself so I was always
in there uh getting lessons and and
making the changes and then I did study
committees so we avoided quorums of our
committee members but we would have
dinners where it's like four of us would
go and have pizza and we'd take three
hours and we'd walk through every single
line of the bill uh and then I do the
next four committee members we do the
same thing and we did that over and over
and over every single draft our
committee I wanted them to know because
the biggest kind of attack point for
lobbyists just to go after the people
who don't seem to understand what the
bill is doing uh and cause disruption
and cause questions and the public um
and so our committee is solid um
lobbyists kind of gave up on our
committee like three weeks before it
left uh the bill was voted out basically
saying like they couldn't make Headway
and they just said like to me they said
we'll see you in the Senate like
basically good luck we give up on you uh
but we're we're gonna kill it in the
Senate um and so I went to the Senate na
leag to try to help that kind of got
shut down by lobbyist pressures the
Senate faced a lot of pressures there
and they they caved um and so in that
case uh you know lobbyists continued to
um send emails to like so uh the big
kind of groups like uh CCC and spsc and
that kind of stuff like they were
National lobbyist interests that were
working through local trade associations
like Vermont Chamber of Commerce Vermont
retail and groceries Association um
entities like that ski Association and
so they would have those entities uh
mass email all of their members and
their and their customers and basically
say like uh you need to tell your
legislators to kill this bill or this
bill will kill targeted advertising or
this bill will kill the internet is one
of the things that was said um and so in
each of those cases I would get
forwarded those emails from people and
then I would write rebuttal documents so
if it was like uh this bill will will uh
keep people from being able to small
businesses from being able to advertise
the blue shirt uh or a that they have
upcoming and so then I would work with
uh that whole range of of experts who
were kind of on the team in the
backgrounds uh and we would just write
uh rebuttal responses and I would send
it to every single member of the body um
so all the senators all the house
members all of leadership and say like
here's the 20 things they claimed here's
the 20 responses to that it doesn't do
anything that they're saying and so that
just happened over and over and over and
over again um yeah I guess that was that
was the big thing and then they came out
in full force again um not like after
the Senate passed it they came out in
full force to the governor as well um so
moving forward uh we kind of know um now
the timing of all of these different
attacks and the substance of each of
these different attacks and so um and
even amendments so uh you know some
companies would come in and even like
the word is being swapped in for
something else that can dram to
dramatically changed the impact of a
bill so we we have basically a resource
for we're documenting like what were all
the uh amendments that were requested
what are the ramifications of the
Amendments and the words being requested
because it it's not just us it's
happened in in all of the different
states in one form or another the same
thing um the timing rebuttal to things
we're just putting that all in a
resource for other for other people who
are trying to PR pass privacy
legislation
so for our listeners if you are trying
to pass privacy legislation Monique uh
has put together a tried and true
resource book so that's fantastic uh
Monique you have a long background in
technology when you look at AI
artificial intelligence which is
according to most people uh uh it's
going to be the Revolutionary technology
of our time um what concerns you about
AI that you know the concerns that need
regulation we have an executive order
from
uh President Biden there have been over
100 bills more than 100 bills that have
been initiated in Congress
unfortunately uh we have a congress
right now where we can't get anything
done uh but talk about your concerns uh
from a state standpoint or just overall
standpoint yeah sure I and I think the
the data privacy work itself has really
like this was a new space for me and the
artificial intelligence space is a new
space for me and but setting the base
with privacy and just thinking about um
just thinking about the ways that like
uh people are collecting and using data
in general without our our knowledge
most of the time or just like not
ignorance basically like not paying
attention or not knowing the
ramifications um that's and even at a
base level like fair and deceptive use
of data like there's a lot of ground
level stuff if you get into deep fake
like thinking about the what goes into a
deep fake and thinking about like
biometric protections and things like
that so I think
like at a base level the data is most
concerning to me because then when you
layer Artificial Intelligence on top of
it then you are able to automate and
like
exponentially you know speed up uh the
poor uses and dangerous uses of data so
for me like the art icial intelligence
pieces are
um I guess like thinking about real
world examples of what like terrifies me
is things like if we're talking about
people being able to use data to make
discriminatory decisions on people for
instance like if you're trying to get a
loan or if you're trying to get a job or
housing or anything like that and then
you think about uh people using
artificial intelligence like automated
engines to then magnify that like um
multiply that so that it's just
constantly happening without even any
humans being involved in the process
like that's really scary like how do you
interrupt how do you how are you able to
defend yourself how are you even able to
know as a human that that that is
happening to you that you're being
discriminated against so the
Discrimination the bias piece um also
just thinking like uh a lot of this like
I've been following so many different
people on on LinkedIn um in the privacy
and artificial intelligence space
and really just thinking about the fact
that we when it comes to this we no
longer at least in the United States at
least in Vermont we don't teach ethics
anymore we don't teach like philosophy
um and really what it comes down to is
like what do we value as a human be like
as what makes us human and the autonomy
that we want over how we operate in the
world and how the world kind of
interacts with us and so artificial
intelligence piece to me is so
fascinating because it's just that on
steroids it's like what do we what do we
want for our future and the way that we
are we live and interact of the world um
and so it really just gets the those
ethical and and philosophical questions
of like what do we you know what are we
doing here how do we want to be
interactive within their economy um yeah
I was just gonna enthusiastically Echo
that I that is what I come back to that
all the time that this really is ethical
questions and it's not not just how AI
is being used but how AI is being
developed if I'm unethically training an
AI can someone ethically use that AI if
copyrighted works for example have been
used to educate that to train that AI um
so you what you say really resonates
with me and I I think it is um value
statements and when it comes to data
it's similar we allow corporations to
surveil us in a way that we would never
allow a government but then the
government can buy the surveillance data
from the corporation I mean it it's just
it's chilling and um here in Vermont
Vermont is a very rural place it's also
very small everything's on the human
scale everybody knows each other between
the two of us Mo'Nique and I literally I
I would I'm sure we know like 80% of
everyone in ver M like between the two
of us I mean it's just a small place
there only 640,000 people who live here
and and for that reason people value
their privacy it's kind of part of the
ethos here and they value just you know
being able to like be in the Woods by
themselves I mean that we've all had
that experience hiking or going to a
state park or something I mean it's just
a very rural place and I think that the
idea that people and corporations are
surveilling us is chilling to Vermont
because we're used to having this kind
of freedom and independent of Freedom
it's like right on the license plate
it's our state motto freedom and unity
and I think that um being free from
corporate surveillance is is is a value
that we have here in
Vermont so uh you know Monique talked
about biases ethics and you also have
talked about it charity the way the
large language models which is you know
the chart gpts and others of the world
work is they ingest or they suck up a
lot of the data that exist on the
internet now some there have been some
lawsuits by new uh by you know New York
Times and others on open Ai and others
but the data that they're sucking up is
data that would have biases in there
because when you go on the internet
there's all kinds of opinions and Views
in there and then there could be
decision making but also there is the
the whole privacy issue so when you look
at artificial intelligence making those
decisions and you look at your privacy
bill is there
any um issue that kind of you run up
against uh California has now is in the
process of passing a big AI Bill and
they're facing the on slau that you
faced Monique of uh corporate backlash
because the big argument that corporates
make and I want to also have you address
that is innovation versus regulation and
that's the big uh question that happens
is that we uh charity you talked about
we are a capitalist economy we live on
Innovation uh and some of these
companies say if you Tire hands too much
you're going to lose out on a lot of the
Innovation that drives this country that
creates the jobs Etc so I would love for
uh you both to address some of these
issues that AI is being discussed about
I think it's really critical for people
to understand what a corporation is a
corporation is designed to make money
for its shareholders if it has failed to
do that it has failed as a corporation
they're not designed to be eth ethics
professors or philosophy professors and
we can't fault them for not being that
but we also can't believe them when they
say that they're doing things for
anything other than earning money for
their shareholders that's what a
corporation by design has to do anyone
who took corporations in law school and
is listening to this this class that's
like you know week one of that class um
so that's really important to have as a
foundation um because it's critical to
understand what their job is and it's in
contrast to our job as Regulators as
public servants protecting people and
speaking of people I also have said this
before you know we're in charge not
corporations we are in charge this is a
government for the people of the People
by the people not for the big tech tech
of the big Tech by the big Tech we're in
charge and we get to decide so I think
that our laws should prioritize
protecting us protecting children and
not protecting um the concept of
innovation as
as framed by a corporation who's
designed to make money for its
shareholders and not necessarily
designed to protect people from the
potential unintended consequences for
example of that and I want to give you
an example you had San you had talked
about the bias built into some of the AI
there is a company advertising on
Twitter so I see it I don't know what
how they picked me but there there it is
and they drive me crazy because they're
trying to demonstrate that you can
prompt the AI to provide a picture and
it will provide a picture except the
prompt keeps saying a girl a girl
wearing a pink dress in winter and it
produces a woman wearing a pink dress in
Winter and it's driving me crazy because
I don't say girl when I'm describing a
woman that is sexist and so the fact
that the AI doesn't know that instead of
producing a girl is producing a woman it
drives me nuts I always screenshot it
and then complained to a friend Monique
I probably showed you screenshot of how
annoyed I am at this at this AI so
that's just a little example that I have
have suffered suffered with in my in my
use of of
Twitter uh Monique your thoughts
Innovation Innovation
regulation ingesting all the data you
know how this whole thing works yeah um
I think I mean I will start off with
just uh kind of riffing off some
examples from uh the age of surveillance
capitalism by Shan as you buff and then
uh why privacy matters by Neil Richards
and like those two books recently I've
been um been reading and um they equate
um what's happening right now uh with
data privacy and with artificial
intelligence um to colonialism and so
like at thinking about like land as
being a resource that people come and
they lay they claim rights to uh it
doesn't matter kind of like who's being
affected they will you know in that case
you're uh whoever is colonizing is like
saying they're going to make things
better and offering a thing at the
expense of whoever was on that land and
so they equate that to basically like we
are the lands our data is the lands um
who gets to decide uh that which which
of our what of our data is up for grabs
uh how they're going to use the data um
how uh kind of the power dynamics of who
owns the data um and what that gets used
for and so that that to me is horrifying
like that that is pure uh we are looking
at the more data you have the more money
you have the more power you have the
more influence you have um the more you
can manipulate human beings um you know
thinking about all of the uh so things
like data Brokers so for for anybody
that's kind of listening like it doesn't
matter if you go to Facebook and use
Facebook if you go to a website you have
a device at all that is any way
connected to the internet there is
somebody scraping collecting the data of
you know the angle your phone is at and
like who you're next to and like uh if
it's a websites things we ran into um
after we started looking into things
where you might be logging into your
bank and think it's perfectly safe or
you're a healthcare provider and think
it's perfect perfectly safe but if they
have uh cookies and things like that
installed on their websites that are
then interacting like they may not be
protected by any type of privacy like
login security features um so anything
you're like doing whether or not you
realize and you think you're in a safe
space there are always cookies that are
collecting as much data as they can and
those are uh being sold um you know
between large kind of like data holders
or data Brokers of which there are
thousands I think the last count I heard
from people in this space is
likely there's like 8,000 different
state of Brokers operating in that in
kind of worldwide 3,000 that tends to
fit State examples of definitions of
what that is but they're just constantly
selling our data putting it at risk um
and like the more data that a company
has on us they know our full personality
they know our psychological kind of like
condition at a time so they will use
those to like Target um that and also to
to kind of the as sh
the behavioral surplus of like all of
the information that we have can then be
used to manipulate what we do when we do
it who we do it with why we do it all
that kind of stuff so that so that is
really getting to like um I in the sun's
conspiratorial but like like a type of
Mind Control like we are being
manipulated to do certain things at the
whims of businesses trying to make money
like that's horrifying so I am a techie
I love Tech I love Innovation but has to
be responsible and it has to be thinking
about like also like what is the how far
are we going to take this and like what
is left when we are fully manipulating
humans and at the whims of Corporations
then what are what is being a human
anymore if not a robot to corporations
interests that's a very important point
so uh question for both of you should
companies that are using AI in their
products have a duty to dis close that
they are using AI let's say whether it's
for hiring or for uh you know for uh
loans or things of that nature making
judgments or decisions is that something
what are your thoughts on
that I I would say that the the range of
AI is so dramatic I don't think that you
would want to um like exclude the use of
AI I when you look at what AI is it's
like very basic things I think what
we're talking about is is generative Ai
and that to me is you've crossed over
into an area that does cause me concern
for a number of reasons some of which
we've talked about so I I do feel like
there's a distinction between AI
generally and then generative Ai and I'm
interested to hear what Monique has to
say yeah I agree with the distinction uh
but then I also like when it comes to
automation I I do think that there
should be disclosures especially when
we're starting to get into um yeah being
turned down for loans uh being I mean
automatically like one of my bills
ag14 uh was one um that was um it was uh
employee monitoring and automated
decision making so that was like uh you
know measuring whether or not the heat
of whether or not I'm sitting in my
chair my retina scans of whether or not
I'm reading my computer screen whether
or not I'm jiggling my mouse whether or
not I went to the bathroom and got off
my chair um but something like an
automated uh you know if you if you add
automation to that and I get up for 10
minutes and go use the bathroom and come
back uh does an automated um system that
doesn't have a human in it anymore fire
me uh and then not actually look into
why and so like I think that in the very
least when people are signing up for
services when they are uh getting a job
when they're applying for a loan they
should know that there may be some
automated type of like decision- making
happening because there could be
something they need to have basically I
think a re um a recourse for something
happened uh as Charity was saying like a
I can't uh tell the difference between a
girl and a woman so can it decide
between whether and I got up for a
certain reason or whether or not I you
know actually left my job for a little
while so like there needs to be until I
mean I don't know where it's gonna be I
don't know where anybody like nobody
knows um fully where it's going to be
but um it there needs to be ways to
interrupt and basically say like I think
it you know the wrong decision was made
based on the criteria and the assessment
that that AI made um we have we have to
be able to like
interject uh what Monique is kind of
alluding to is now companies because the
workers are now uh working from home
companies have come up with a technology
to figure out if your mouse is not
moving if you're actually working or not
and a lot of companies are implementing
that
Technologies uh and you could argue
either way uh for that uh one of the
things uh and this is really for both of
you is when you look at creating
legislation let's just say that
somewhere in the future you create AI
bills or AI legislation the technology
is moving so fast today if you look uh
Monique you are a
you know technology person we started
from large language models now you're
into multimodal you're now into agents
Etc how is policy going to keep up with
how technology is any uh charity any
thoughts Monique any thoughts in that I
think education is critical and one of
the things that has continues to
surprise me is I think companies are
asking for forgiveness and not
permission and they're trying to
normalize the use of AI and the use of
collection of data before it alarms us
they're trying to just normalize it I
recently bought a car I I have had the
same car for 10 years so my old car is
not very high-tech and I bought a new
car and I was I've been so irritated
because it beeps all the time at
different stuff and I tried to download
the app and it told me and of course
because I read the Privacy disclosure
like a lot of people probably don't and
it said we're going to collect your data
and we're going to do whatever we want
with it and I was very annoyed and I
went to chat to say I don't want this
how do I avoid it and the chat was like
here's the privacy policy and I had to
once again agree to you know disclosing
all of my data and um so I have to call
them and complain and then I tried to
hook up my phone to my car and it was
like oh well you don't have Sirion and I
was like well of course I don't have
serion I'm a data privacy Advocate and
they won't let me use the system and so
here I bought this new car and my
ability to take use of the amenities
that are supposed to be included in my
my fancy car um my fancy new car are
being I'm being deprived of them because
I'm not able to use them without uh you
know um compromising my data privacy
which I'm not willing to do the idea
that this has been so normalized that
I'm having this experience but probably
most people are just like oh okay and
you know allowing their data privacy to
be handed over to a company you
literally purchased a car from I mean
what could be more expensive than a car
and yet they still are trying to get
your data for free um I find it really
troubling so I am going to I am going to
call them I'm going to get to doing that
I'll report back when I do but I think
this like they're trying to normalize it
and it's really up to us to educate
legislators the public um media about
what this might look like and what the
implications could be so that we can as
Moi so eloquently put like disrupt and
just check in and say how are we
benefiting from this because so far what
I have seen is people making money is
the big benefit and the rest of us have
some fun making a limmerick at someone's
retirement party using chat GPT but
really I would rather have my data be my
own and have my privacy um than have the
Lor and I don't I I also am I mean I
continue to marel I know I sound like
our esteemed senior Senator Bernie
Sanders but I continue to Marvel that
all the Decades of techn technological
advancement and we're not working less
we're working more and there's more
poverty and less housing and said well
what's the point of the technology other
than to make money for for certain
people if it's not if we're not all
benefiting from this and I hope that
we're on the horizon of an era of AI
where we're going to get to you know
work less and enjoy more and be
healthier and be happier but I I have to
admit I have my I have my cynicism at
this point uh in the in the juncture of
our journey with
AI uh monik any thoughts yeah I think uh
for me it's like a hard a hard balance
because because of all of the lob being
interests like the the more likely you
are to get a bill I think what we're
seeing right now against big Tech is to
have multiple States run the same like
policy so the plans for kind of AI is
like 10 or so States running this more
or less the same policy uh together but
in that case like I don't know that we
can get it as strong as we need to in
any unified way um because every state
is going to face different degrees of
lobbing efforts depending on who's
really in their state um in a lot of
ways um but at the same time uh so like
any thing that I do like I'm still going
to continue to run by as many people as
possible in the background in the space
and also start to bring in more
ethicists and things like that like
people who are understanding that that's
important for me but but I also
like it would be nice to be able to
almost like slow down or not continue to
repeat like the same policies that were
written in large part by Tech by like
Amazon workers and stuff like that
workday is writing some AI AP policies
from what I heard um
so like thinking about at a basic level
this is why the privacy policy was so
important to me is like you in like kind
of getting to a root level of things
like uh discrimination and data and
things like that could happen at a more
fundamental level than in a in AI policy
um and also things like looking at the
underlying fair and deceptive uses act
in the the consumer protection act like
they're we are using Ai and all of the
the mechanisms that are used kind of
absorbing the data and using the data
but at a fundamental level like there
are Roots there of like basic
expectations of business and things like
that and we I think we're largely
ignoring uh safe protections of like
even privacy like we if somebody walked
into our house we would say that is an
invasion of privacy but then we have
alexas and we have Siri devices and we
have everything else we have Smart
cameras we have Smart fridges so there
Earth there
is like you know cataloging where
couches so we we are uh I think the
public you know is including myself like
I have I have since gotten rid of quite
a few devices of quite a few apps off my
phone uh I have disconnected My Car app
like things like that like uh but the
average public does not realize one that
they're not protected they think they're
protected and two they don't realize
that like no matter what they do
somebody is like getting that to sell it
and so um I think uh like Char said
basic consumer education I think would
go a long way um and then also just
thinking at a fundamental level like
what do we actually value um as a as a
population and trying to figure out like
how do we stop uh things from getting
away at a very at the earliest kind of
like basic level in
policy I think uh that's a great great
Point uh charity monik for our Global
listeners who have asked this question
EU was able to pass gdpr the United
States is the big technological power we
still don't have a federal Privacy Act
and recently uh congresswoman Kathy MC
uh Morris M Rogers and uh they tried to
but I understand that also has been
Shel why is it that we've not been able
to do some of these things which I you
know that other have been able to do it
I mean when privacy you look at your
state as you said P you know privacy is
very important uh and I'm sure it's
important in other states Vermont can't
be an outlier uh but why is that that's
one of the questions that came for
you yeah I think a few different things
here so yeah so out of the top 20 uh
economies of the world the United States
is the only one without a uh Universal
kind of like Countrywide policy which is
hor like
terrifying that just seems super broken
um and
um yeah I mean it is uh I think it's a
few things one it's absolutely money and
power like all of the entities that we
have that we're talking about they are
based in the United States so we're on
home turf uh trying to have that war um
I also uh thinking in some cases when we
started getting into like the policy
pieces and trying to think about gdpr um
in some ways and I'm not I'm not saying
I'm anti First Amendment but the First
Amendment like does that does have like
a weird Rift where we if we're trying to
like do protections we're often coming
up to that and then we're also coming up
to like what a corporation say falls
under free speech so things like you
know a lot of companies are claiming
that code itself falls under free speech
um so there's like some weird mechanisms
there that are pretty hard to navigate
um and also just I think in general uh
our population is just not um we're
we're not talking about privacy enough
we're not talking about the cost of of
operating um in America in general where
we expect everything to be easy and we
expect everything to like you know uh be
quick on our smartphones and um
convenience I feel like and so uh we
need to talk about the cost of
convenience um and the cost of of what
we're giving up by interacting with so
many businesses on a on a given day um
and again not not coming up out against
those I'm I am a fan of all of these SE
all of the se but um but we need to
start talking about the the cost to our
Humanity I think the other thing that
that we have in this country is um we're
very entrepreneurial and we don't we
never want to squelch Innovation I mean
we've I America has invented a lot of
cool stuff and we have been on the
Vanguard of innovation and I think we're
proud of that it's part of kind of the
fabric of who we are and so no one likes
the idea of I know pumping the brakes
but I think finding that balance is so
critical and what we have not had as you
have R pointed out is uh Federal
involvement on regulating this I have
hope that that could happen I will say
I'm always very nervous because um you
know Vermont with other laws that we
have although this law it it this bill
did not become law I think it will be
eventually um a law and I don't want
some watered down version of what we
have or what California has or
Connecticut or Illinois I I want a
robust bill so it makes me uneasy I
think a National Standard is better to
comply with it involves certainly
educating the general public but it also
I have sense of uneasiness because I
want to make sure that it's robust and
appropriate and one of the benefits to
people of having this patchwork quilt in
in the United States is that every state
gets to to pass a bill that reflects its
own values which might be different from
a state 3,000 miles
away yeah and I think the point you're
making is it's the impact of money and
it's the impact of uh maybe the public
is not as aware like maybe in warmont
the public is as you said you know you
know they value their privacy a lot
talking about this uh uh for both of you
you saw what has happened in social
media charity you talked a lot about
that it's become the dominance of five
six companies you know uh whether it's
the metas ETC the big fear right now is
the same thing is about to happen with
AI because it takes a lot of money a lot
of these expensive chips that you have
to have you have to train it costs
literally hundreds of millions of
dollars to produce a foundation one and
it is getting Consolidated into these
companies that first they control our uh
social media Our Town Square now they
could control this are there things that
can be done and now I'm talking to you
as a state level not specifically at a
warmont but at a state level that you
think can prevent something like this
from happening and this is for our
listeners outside also that have raised
this question about a Glo about this AI
Monopoly that's about to
happen I I have been um I mean like I
say some of this is very concerning to
me but some of it is fascinating so I
have been fascinated by the rush to roll
out not ready for Prime Time products
and things going wrong and you think
about things going wrong with Brands
you've never heard of but when Google
has a disaster you know you're thinking
I can't believe this this is ter I mean
it's it's almost comical to see how
eager everyone is to own the market to
be the big player so that they can get
there first so I honestly I think that
that needs to be said um and maybe now
is that the time to say it it's like
yeah we're we're we're eager to regulate
them at the same time they're obviously
racing to perfect their product um so
while we're racing Mo'Nique and I are
reing to educate people and and act in
Vermont I mean I think their products
really aren't quite there yet and that's
going to have an impact too because
people are going to be reluctant once
they try a product and you know an AI
model and they don't like it or have a
bad experience or becomes kind of a joke
um then they're not going to have this
the consumer confidence to use it so I I
want to begin by just saying that um in
terms of what can be done I mean we
Mo'Nique and I in approaching this have
felt that there needs to be a foundation
on data privacy first and if your state
is lacking that Foundation un regulating
data privacy it's it's trickier to layer
on AI and what does that what does AI
mean and frankly part of that is because
there needs to be an education about
data and why data is important I mean
that needs to happen first before I
think the AI is meaning or not not that
it can't be meaningful but I think it's
going to be a cleaner process because
people will already have that knowledge
of how the internet works and and all of
that and be themselves curious cuz
that's how I think Monique and I got
here is we're both very curious people
and we think about what the implications
are I mean AI it's like every day I come
up with a new potential implication for
AI that I hadn't thought of the day
before and it's it is really fascinating
and and I like Monique I'm reading books
too that I find it's so interesting so I
don't know maybe Mo'Nique has a cleaner
example of the way that she thinks we
can lead in this
space GRE uh It's Curious like out a out
a cynical off the cuff like can we
interrupt uh Tech monopolies I am not
sure um but I but but something you know
that happened recently with the the EU
um AI act um you know there were certain
features uh that met us that it was not
going to run in the EU because it's
running into the the law so that for me
Isn't a that that is a flag of like oh
oh uh you know what is um red flag of
like what is EU um blocking meta from
doing basically probably safely respons
L um and if enough countries enough
States and enough countries around the
world um were to like do that disruptive
thing that the EU uh just did like they
would have to figure something else out
right but we we have to like we have to
collaborate state to state we have to
collaborate country to Country um this
is this is a global thing um and each of
us I think one thing I've seen is like
you know people will say and even myself
that like oh Vermont can't like it can't
actually interrupt anything in the
United States it's such a small state
but we did like it was a it was a big
press piece to have a priv private right
of action and I'm learning like I was
you know we were basing our laws off
precedence of what other states were
doing and that's that's powerful like
because as soon as you have one state
that did it then it kills the lobbyist
arguments of like nobody's doing this
you're the first one you can't do this
like no but that state did it um so I
think like I I do think that like little
by little as long as like people are
coordinating and collaborating and
working off of each other like there is
power in that um and I think that we are
too siloed in so many ways um and if we
just start talking uh I think there's a
lot of power in uh in teamwork um so uh
she talked about power and teamwork
charity are other AGS around the country
concerned about some of the same things
you are concerned about with AI
yeah definitely um you know in in States
the Attorneys General are the ones who
enforce consumer protection laws and
this is very clearly consumer issue um
and we also sort of all have this um you
know like I I I'm a mom and I I I
sometimes refer to myself as like Mama
Bear where I'm always feeling like I'm
protecting the people of Veron
especially children but I'm protecting
everybody it's just that's my instinct
and a lot of AGS have that same kind of
and so when they see something like this
their instinct is to protect and um you
know we have consumer laws we have
antitrust laws the extent that there's
an illegal Monopoly um that we won't
hesitate to enforce I mean that's why we
were elected and and I'm proud to to to
be the person doing that work um but the
other thing I I wanted to flag is that
consumers themselves are very powerful
and I my I have um one of my sisters
says uh you know she votes with her fork
and she she vots with the food she buys
that's what she's how she expresses her
values and consumers do that too at some
point if you make a product that's not
desirable people aren't going to buy it
or if you make a product that they might
like but is Tainted in some way with
some history and we've all seen that um
you know no one wants to buy it because
it's the brand isn't cool or it's um
diminished in some capacity so I think
that's another part of the puzzle is
making sure that consumer behavior is
kept in mind and consumer awareness is
um is is part of the conversation
because I think that consumers
themselves I mean they're the ones who
are driving this and they can the the
problem that I we keep coming up on is
the fact that consumers simply don't
know that they're buying something I'm
doing air quotes here they're buying
something with their data and when
they're buying something with their
money they're aware of it but they're
buying something with their data they
don't they aren't aware of it and to the
extent that a company is screening the
internet for their data for their photo
or whatever and using it to make money
and they're not getting any money that
always bugs me because what what your
listeners might not have picked up so
far is that actually Mo'Nique and I are
real advocates for small businesses I
grew up working in a small business I am
the daughter granddaughter and
great-granddaughter of smalltown Vermont
Grocers I spent a ton of time working in
my family's little grocery store in a
ski town and Monique is a champion in
her town for small businesses and part
of the space on Maine is like you know
the smallest businesses coming together
to have a co-working space so we
actually are actually real you know
corporate movers here in Vermont and so
um you know I think it's all very
valuable um and we want a Marketplace
that works but that involves all of us
um you know be having awareness and I do
resent as a as a I'm guess I'm more
corporate friendly sometimes than I
realize but I do resent the idea that
people are giving up their data someone
else is making money off of it and
they're not getting a cut like can you
imagine
if you know someone grew plants grew
carrots in my on my land in my yard sold
the carrots at the farmers market and I
never got a cut right that's so like
anti our philosophy here in Corporate
America you know our our capitalist
world so it's um it doesn't seem to be
functioning well and I think part of it
is because consumers don't really
realize how things work so I think
charity you're making two very powerful
points is consumer education is very
important and they can make a decision
by the companies that they buy products
from or they ignore if they don't share
the values that they have and what you
the other point I think you're making is
if their data is being used they need a
cut uh because it is their data and they
need to have a financial piece of uh the
action is what you're saying I mean
that's what I think is literally the
Baseline fundamental ethos of this whole
bill and movement is that consumer data
belongs to Consumers it's ours and
that's what this bill was trying to
address and confirm and
codify well that's
fantastic I could go on for an hour more
because I have so many other because the
two of you makes I I'm sure you know
there's a tremendous Synergy with the
two of you in terms of the ying and the
Yang but uh we we have some quick
lightning round questions because I know
know you have busy things to do so you
either one of you can pick up generally
we like you to pick up answer one word
but in your case uh because the AG is
also online we'll make an exception so
here we go uh this is uh just a little
fun stuff uh to either of you
transparency or privacy which one would
you want privacy okay okay automation or
human oversight
no
oversight okay open source AI or
proprietary AI
Monique open source okay uh this is for
either of you in National AI policies or
International AI
Frameworks dreaming big
I like the flexibility to be honest I'm
a federalist I guess I like the
flexibility of having different
approaches and we learn all the time
from oh I'm saying way too many words I
was going to say we learn a lot from
Europe and other countries and I like
that so that's my take okay uh is AI a
greater risk or an opportunity for
society is it a greater risk or is it
opportunity for
society
opportunity okay uh will AI increase or
decrease economic
inequality well it depends on how we
regulate
it it's all of these depend on how I
regulate great answer great answer well
this has been fabulous I really want to
thank uh both of you for joining today
and sharing your incredible insights on
these crucial topics you know your work
in Vermont really is is serving as a for
other states and other regions grappling
with the complex task of you know
creating these very very tough
regulations and to our listeners uh the
efforts of Attorney General Clark and
representative Priestly highlight the
importance of proactive thoughtful work
in shaping the future of privacy
technology and Ai and I think their work
demonstrates that even at the state
level significant strides can be made in
ensuring that technology development AI
aligns with our values and protects our
rights so as we conclude this session
really want to thank them both for the
work that they're doing and really hope
that we can have them back for a real
funfilled informative session so thank
you uh charity and thank you Monique
