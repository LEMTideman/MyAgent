nir
are is what the objective there is to
democratize access to the high-speed
chips required to train your Cutting
Edge AI
systems welcome to the regulating AI
podcast join host Sanjay pury as he
explores the dynamic and developing
world of artificial intelligence
governance each episode features deep
Dives with global leaders at the
Forefront of regulating AI responsibly
tackling the challenges using AI can
bring about head-on and enabling balance
without hindering
[Music]
Innovation welcome to regulating AI a
podcast dedicated to Bringing diverse
Global voices together to discuss the
creation of fair and Equitable AI
regulation I your host Sanjay Puri and
today we are honored to have with us
Senator Todd young of Indian Senator
young has been at the Forefront of
bipartisan efforts to address the
challenges and opportunities presented
by artificial intelligence as a key
member of the bipartisan Senate AI
working group he has played a crucial
role in developing a comprehensive
approach to AI policy in the US Senate
today we'll be discussing the recent AI
policy road map released by The
bipartisan Senate AI work group as well
as Senator Young's perspectives on
regulating Ai and ensuring us leadership
in this critical field Senator young
welcome to the regulating AI podcast
thanks for having me on sanj I really
appreciate it thank you Senator Senator
we have a global audience uh you know
it's made up of uh members of congress
senate uh their staff think tanks as
well as members in Europe Parliament
CEOs of companies Etc so for our Global
audience can you explain the Genesis of
the bipartisan Senate eii working
group yeah
absolutely well uh Senator Schumer and I
two of the four bipartisan collaborators
in this effort uh we have a a history of
working together on semiconductors we
were co-authors of the chips and science
act and uh of course uh chips uh are are
a u uh are are an essential part of of
training AI systems and and uh so uh
there was sort of a natural
extension of our our work there into
this artificial intelligence uh
collaboration but really what catalyzed
our work and focused our minds was the
chat GPT moment when uh it became clear
to the American people that we were
already in the midst of an AI
Revolution and uh we began to think
critically about some of the
implications of this some of course were
immediately uh everyone was captivated
by by uh jat GPT but many were concerned
about some of the risks posed by this
new technology and the risks associated
with an AI enabled world uh Senator
Schumer myself Martin Heinrich and Mike
rounds uh all shared this desire for us
to continue to lead the world in
innovating
as it relates to artificial intelligence
and and uh we understood that we didn't
get out in front of some of the
perceived
risks then uh there was a risk of of
overshooting with respect to a
regulatory atmosphere and uh falling
behind the Chinese Communist party and
others well that's uh great uh Senator
uh You released an AI policy road map
can you tell our listeners some of the
key priorities that were outlined in
this doc
cuman well absolutely um one of the
things that uh we we uh learned very
early on as as we began to prepare to
draft this road
map was that our existing laws really
addressed uh Schumer myself rounds and
Heinrich all agreed uh address most of
the concerns that people had uh we we
have privacy laws consumer protection
laws uh uh norms and and laws around
transparency um on and on intellectual
property but the real challenge as we
saw was adapting these existing statutes
and and bodies of legal precedent to an
AI enabled world to the
extent new challenges uh present and
weren't captured in existing laws what
have to tweak our our statutes and
that's how I think most of us would
characterize it would be tweaks and and
GAP filling uh and to the extent that
existing laws really do translate uh
Sometimes some additional regulations
will have to be drafted but the actual
uh statutes or or
precedents uh that that
uh on which those regulations are based
uh you know we just need to oversee that
process so um you know the the we begin
to think about how our longstanding uh
laws around some of these areas of
concern actually could apply the less
daunting our legislative work struck us
uh with with with with that said uh
there there are a handful of areas
number one we want to do our best on an
ongoing basis to
identify what risk do exist and what
barriers to further
Innovation uh regulatory barriers in
particular exist existed uh because
those would both of those would be
fertile grounds for Congressional
legislation on an ongoing
basis we of course wanted to make sure
that our government fulfilled its
responsibilities in terms of Performing
and funding certain research at uh our
government Labs within the military and
uh through our University system
historically uh that's been an important
role um we we uh believe that uh this
world of of AI enablement is going to
require the United States to revisit
some of our Workforce training and the
way we educate uh folks and and uh the
laws around all of that perhaps creating
a a nimbler environment in in which
people can relearn certain jobs and and
uh retrain uh if if a large large uh
portion of of their work has been
displaced through
Automation and then uh within government
almost every agency of government I
think we'll have to rethink how we
recruit and retain Personnel it's going
to be very important for us to have
experts within government who can
interface with those on the outside of
of of government about use of a I within
their areas of
jurisdiction uh and uh who have the
level of discernment required to
identify when existing laws uh are
addressing some of the policy concerns
that business uh and rank and file
Americans uh will have and uh to work
with Congress and and other entities on
uh addressing those shortcomings so I
mean that's a host of different uh
issues that arose those are some of the
major themes there were of course others
discussed in our 30 page road map as you
know no so I think uh Senator you made
some very important points one was uh
obviously you know we have existing laws
for lot of things like privacy consumer
protection Etc maybe tweaking or filling
the gaps is one thing that you said um
the other thing is that you talked about
how government agencies use Ai and also
our work work force uh and that's an
important issue of the reskilling of our
Workforce because this technology as
everybody predicts is going to change a
lot of things for a lot of people do you
see the government the federal
government or the state government
having a role in this transition uh
Senator well I do uh I one thing we need
to do and I had some legislation to this
effect is is to to uh equip our private
sector uh more generously to go out and
and uh take train their workers to apply
artificial intelligence to whatever
business environment they're they're
working in we have existing tax law that
incentivizes business owners to do this
uh but it needs to become more generous
because I think increasingly it's going
to fall on business owners to see that
their
employees really are uh AI uh Savvy uh
in their work and uh that will be an
issue not just for
domestic uh uh you know concern but but
also an issue of global competitiveness
so that's that's certainly one thing we
need to do you know I think uh K through
12 it's not in the main a federal
government responsibility but it has
National even International applications
and we're going to have to get better at
whether you call it through 12 or prek
through 14 as many now refer to it we
need our young people to be comfortable
with algorithms have some knowledge of
coding but more importantly uh become
Adept and and um uh very used to uh
using AI Technologies and
applying uh the latest artificial
intelligence uh you know uh Technologies
to to their work U so that's uh that's
certainly something we haven't been
doing extensively in the past at a young
age and I think that's going to become
in increasingly important of course the
federal government has long paid to send
people to postsecondary schools from
Community College to college all the way
to postgrad and the things the skills
that we're investing in are going to
have to shift as uh the demands of our
economy changes as well
well I think that's a great point that
uh there has to be a shift in there uh
Senator you this uh policy framework
asked for 32 billion that became so to
speak the headline everybody else forgot
about what else was in there everybody
said 32 billion so for our listeners for
once maybe you can tell them what is
this 32 billion so to speak for uh and
how are because it's going to be paid by
the US taxpayers so just to give them a
sense of why and
what well yeah you know it's it's a a
fair question and naturally when you
have a 30-page document I I think
especially members of the non-technical
media are looking for things that are
very understandable and accessible and
everyone understands a large dollar
figure so that
would this uh $32 billion figure would
go into this was recommended by the
National Security Commission on
artificial intelligence several years
ago they actually recommended $32
billion because it was the Judgment of
of that independent group that it would
take a $32 billion public
investment um so that our our our
certain types of research that wouldn't
otherwise happen in the private sector
uh could occur in furtherance of our
national security
um can't itemize every research project
that that would uh fund but there sorts
of things you will fund or are things
that have you know a broader public good
uh so one could imagine in addition to
the direct National
Security Innovations and and coding that
would occur and that would happen
through interfacing with our war
Fighters and and all who support them
um there there are certain Investments
that could benefit an entire sector
think of trains of all things I actually
stumbled across this one in recent weeks
I was visiting with some representatives
of of competing railroads and I asked
them how they use artificial
intelligence and and they cited some uh
work occurring at uh uh one of her major
research universities to
observe anomalies within the wheel
bearings on rail cars uh so when these
anomalies which are highly unsafe and
and can lead to the derailment of of
rail cars including those carrying toxic
uh materials when those anomalies occur
there' be an early warning you can shut
down the real car and um because we have
the ability to to look at these things
uh we're we're uh protecting the
American people and more likely to keep
using a very efficient way of of of of
of moving things from A to B so
um
what could this be internalized to a
company well I mean when you start to
think about that your
your Norfolk
southers of the world are not they don't
have the internal expertise and it would
cost a whole lot for them to develop it
to have a sort of a an AI Skunk Works
it's not really a high-tech
business uh and and it would be highly
inefficient economically to have
competing railroads and there are many
across the country including the
Shortline
railroads that that are are going out
and having to fund all this research be
a lot more efficient uh if if we did
this through our research universities
and and and so forth so so this is the
kind of thing you can imagine occurring
in the biological
sciences um not just in transportation
in in food
Sciences you know I mean on and on and
um uh we will just have to see what sort
of
applications scientists
postdocs send in uh so that uh you know
they can perform research but the idea
is not to duplicate things it's also not
to create uh you know it's not a free
riding Dynamic where railroad we all
benefit from railroads the low cost of
shipping and and safe shipping is baked
into so much of what we buy it would be
almost impossible to disaggregate that
and historically our federal government
has done a really good job at helping to
fund not just basic research but a
certain amount of of Applied research
that has extensive spillover benefits uh
throughout society and that's what we're
trying to
enable I think that's a very important
point we had the director of the NSF on
the podcast and he was talking about how
they're funding community colleges and
other areas in terms of AI um Senator
Senator just shifting uh quickly to
National Security you've been a strong
advocate for us competitiveness
particularly in relation to China how
does China factor into this competition
and what steps do you believe are
necessary for us to keep the US
leadership in
AI well China factors in in a number of
ways number one is
productivity you know we want the
Chinese people to be clear to to have
material Prosperity we want Rank and
file Chinese to to do well but of course
when you look in the aggregate the
productivity of an entire economy
uh one's National Security depends on
that and your military wherewithal and
we don't share the values of the Chinese
Communist parties so we want to be more
productive than the Chinese Communist
party is as we head more deeply into the
21st century so that requires ensuring
that we have um a u a thoughtful
regulatory atmosphere and a clear
regulatory atmosphere so that our
innovators can continue to innovate in
this space and uh that's that's our
objective but more directly the nature
of warfare uh is is already being shaped
as we see in Ukraine and and somewhat uh
in in Gaza and Israel by artificial
intelligence
technology uh we we have seen and and
read about heard about the the uh new
swarming tactics uh being used so lots
of drones uh which are are and and and
uh nautical Vehicles which can
communicate with one another they go out
into an area they receive information uh
from AI algorithms increasingly we will
automate the ability of some of these
platforms to uh to to make uh some of
their own decisions uh and and so making
smarter decisions on a more rapid basis
will be uh essential to uh ensuring that
we win uh the the wars or prevent the
wars hopefully of the 21st century uh it
goes without saying that we want
American Warf fighters to be more
sophisticated when it comes to these
things than uh the Russians the Chinese
the Iranians or others so it's Economic
Security and National Security uh
Senator you mentioned that you uh you
played a key role in the chips and
science act uh uh and which has
significant implications as you said for
a development can you tell explain to
our listeners why this legislation ties
into your broader vision for air policy
oh
absolutely well in order to uh in order
to make sure that we continue to lead
the way when it comes to uh development
of AI uh Technologies there are three
key components one is compute and that's
semiconductors the other is is
algorithms and those are a function
right now of of uh the brains of
individual coders and uh and teams of of
of coders and then the last is data uh
the more quality data you have to train
systems uh the more powerful systems uh
you will
have we uh one one critical link which
was uh interrupted in the midst of the
global pandemic exposing a real
vulnerability in uh our supply chains
was the compute our access to
semiconductors the purpose of the chips
and science Act was to reshore much of
the
manufacturing of these semiconductors so
we'd be less dependent on uh countries
that didn't share our values uh might
even
interrupt the the transfer of these
semiconductors into the United States in
the future and we become more resilient
um and and so there was uh as I said ear
there is kind of a
natural uh connection between my work on
on the semiconductor policy and the
later work we did on artificial
intelligence so it's a co-joined as you
said it's one of the three pegs of a
very important Peg of the three like
stool um Senator talking about uh
democratization of access and you talked
a little bit about that you worked on
the national AI research resource uh you
know the one concern and we get this a
lot from our users as well as guest is
that uh training some of these uh uh
large language models it's almost like
building a blockbuster drug it costs a
billion bucks or half a billion or
whatever it is and small companies
cannot do that so there are two aspects
of to this is how do we make sure that
large tech companies don't do what
social media happened it ended up in the
hands of five or six companies and the
second is the open Source versus closed
Source because it kind of goes handin
hand so your thoughts for our listeners
on that
Senator yes so this is for the
uninitiated and I know you have a lot of
uh users who are very familiar with this
the national AI
uh research resource
niir
R is is uh what the objective there is
to democratize access to to the
high-speed ships required to train your
Cutting Edge uh AI systems and and also
democratize access to many of the large
data sets that are also required to
train uh those models so that uh uh
access to those isn't just a function of
of how much Capital you have in in your
bank accounts but instead we want some
innovators uh perhaps who are are not
for profits or performing uh public
research projects uh or in the earlier
stages of developing a uh business model
have access to uh some of these uh chips
and and so uh that's the the objective
and U we think it's really important the
other thing before we move on to open
versus closed is um large versus small
one other and so you know antitrust has
for a long period of time also refereed
some of these issues although not
directly on point related to AI um ni
trust needs to continue uh to remain the
cop on the beat members of Congress need
to make sure that the Federal Trade
Commission Department of Justice are
doing their jobs and um I don't I'm not
advocating for changing how they've
looked at some of these cases consumer
harm has has been the test during most
of my lifetime but that is something
they're looking at right now and that's
an issue that members of Congress will
need to really um you know be debated
vigorously in in coming months and years
with respect to open and closed Source
oh goodness there are so many opinions
on this issue
and I I see advantages to both of course
and vulnerabilities associated with um
the open
source approach allows more people to
innovate on top of earlier innovations
that has great appeal to me and and um
the whole open source movement is
something that I have an affinity
towards but we do have to get better at
uh addressing some of the security risks
associated with doing that if you take
uh the the handywork of American
disproportionately Silicon Valley
innovators and um and you have a
you know a
state sponsored effort by the Iranian
regime to uh uh to improve upon that in
various ways or Putin's regime um you
know that's that's something we have not
yet figured out how to really address
and and I don't know that we will so
there again um these are one of these
issues that candidly though we Tangled
with a lot of issues and came up with a
lot of solid answers in the road map we
want committees within Congress to take
up the issues as as oftentimes we Define
them and trying to assess what Solutions
there are to them what we didn't
Advocate is if we didn't know we didn't
have a a really clear Direction Where to
go we decided not to pretend that we had
the solution right because otherwise we
could end up constraining this this
industry which would neither uh be in
the interest of our economy or our
national security so uh we we uh decided
to do something members of Congress
don't do often which is demonstrate a
little legislative
humility because of uh this is an
incipient area of Technology well that's
great uh finally Senator Global
collaboration I mean EU has passed an AI
act uh companies work globally uh you
know China is doing its own thing India
is doing its own thing do you see any
um value in harmonization or learning
from uh different laws Etc any thoughts
on that for a global audience I do um
you know it would be great
if China and the United States uh start
with could could
uh could address one another's security
concerns right um I'm highly dubious but
it doesn't mean we shouldn't keep
talking okay but I think uh it's it's
far more
likely that the United States will be
harmonizing our uh technical standards
even our Norms around the use of AI
technology with friends and what we call
partners and to the extent we can we we
can harmonize our domestic laws and land
on uh a large body of technical
standards that are
shared and Norm terms of use to inform F
future Ru making and international
standards um that's going to be in the
best interest of our private sector
innovators and investors who want to
trade with one another and enjoy the
scale that comes with International
markets uh but it's also and this is
that the elegant thing in terms of our
geopolitics we can ensure that our ISS
our are uh values surrounding things of
like privacy and transparency and
consumer protection and and and Norms
against bias towards particular racial
and ethnic groups and and and and so
forth are baked into the very
technology that um is going to drive
growth in the 21st century to me that's
that's really exciting it's an
opportunity for the American people to
ensure that our Universal values which
is what you know um you know the
enlightenment values were all about are
baked into these things now there's a
handful of
countries uh that that will resist that
the Chinese project the Russian project
Iranians Venezuelans and Myanmar and
others uh have in recent years been
about the law of the Jungle and making
sure their leaders are restrained Ed by
any universal values or or or Norms of
behavior so this is um this is uh why
it's it's really essential that we
embark on on this diplomatic
work this law making so that we have so
we establish these standards and and and
Norms uh but we do so delicately so that
we don't constrain our Innovative
potential uh that uh will be important
to our
security so that's uh pretty powerful
that this becomes a means for us to
share our values with others for us to
you know share our technology but also
it becomes a little bit of a soft power
uh that the United States has Senator
that's what you're saying that's right
that's that's
exactly uh What uh what this is about
and I would I would take it just a
slight step further and
argue our convening power
our our ability to persuade others to
work with us to harmonize these
standards is also a function of the fact
that we're trusted we're not always
perfect we're not always consistent but
uh you know and and in the Grand View of
things we are much more trusted than uh
some of the adversary countes I I
mentioned and so this is this is an
economic issue it's a national security
issue but but it's a big time values
issue as
well that's a great Point Senator uh
we've had many guests here but you're
the first one who's made the point that
it is really a values issue um Senator
thank you so much your insight into the
need for increased funding Workforce
consideration and the importance of
maintaining us leadership uh in AI
Innovation for values and National
Security really have provided a valuable
perspective on the future of AI
regulation and and your ability to you
know emphasize bipartisan cooperation
and the need for balanced approach
really uh Fosters Innovation uh while
addressing potential risks uh so thank
you senator for sharing your time and
insights and to our listeners thank you
for tuning into regulating AI we hope
this conversation has provided you with
valuable insights and until next time
this is Sanjay Puri signing off thank
you so much Senator this was uh
fantastic really really great
thanks for having me
on thanks for tuning in to the
