Congress needs to step in and do
something here we're not exactly sure
where the sweet spot is between over
regulating versus providing the right
guard rails and bumpers but if there's
any group out there Congress has a role
to play in that it's going to require
some uh very careful thought and
consideration on retraining of
workforces but I don't see things going
away and being completely eliminated I
don't want to see uh weapon systems go
fully autonomous without a human in the
loop if you have companies that have the
ability to control the data to control
the Computing capacity and have
electricity have the power to do it
which we're now already seeing with with
computer companies buying uh nuclear
facilities uh I think that has the
potential to create the most powerful
companies that have ever existed in the
history of mankind we're going to have
to be careful to not allow that kind of
power to concentrate in the hands of one
or two or three companies and and if we
do that not only is is there huge
potential for that to be exploited but
it will also crowd out all the of the
small people that should have a voice at
the
table welcome to regulating AI the
podcast that brings together diverse
Global voices to discuss fair and
responsible AI regulation I'm your host
Sanjay Puri and today we are honored to
have Congressman Scott Franklin joining
us Congressman Franklin represents
Florida's 18th congressional district
and brings a wealth of experience from
his careers in the Navy insurance and
now in Congress as a member of the House
AI task force and with his background in
technology and agriculture he offers a
unique perspective on AI regulation
welcome to the show Congressman Franklin
thank you sanj good to be here with you
excellent uh Congressman we have a
global audience our audience is made up
of uh Congressional members their staff
think tanks and aicos across the world
um so for them uh you know you had a
very uh diverse career spanning Naval
Aviation business leadership and now
Congress can you tell them how this
background has shaped your approach to
AI policy well I've always been a a a
keen fan of everything that's going on
in science and technology I I kind of
came of age as a young child watching
the Apollo program and uh and seeing how
the Space Administration was able to
make those accomplishments in the late
60s and it followed that all the way
through so I had a my first career in
Naval Aviation I flew Jets off aircraft
carriers after the Navy I was in the
insurance world and and saw uh the
challenges with uh huge amounts of data
that we were trying to synthesize and
process to make good predictive
decisions on what was going to happen in
the future and then now here in Congress
I see across all the different uh
jurisdictions and and uh Community
boundaries how there's a a need to get a
better understanding of AI so I'm I'm
excited to be a part of the task force
and for me it's a lot about my curiosity
just to learn more about it well we are
very lucky to have someone who brings
you know Public Service uh in the Navy
and then industry with um
entrepreneurship and now in Congress
because sometimes it's really important
to get both perspectives so we are
really thankful for that Congressman uh
few of your colleagues um Congressman J
oau and Congressman tedl have both been
on this podcast now you are a member of
the House AI task force for uh our
listeners can you just outline some of
the primary goals of this task force and
how do you see it influencing AI
regulation sure so this uh the Genesis
of this idea kind of started in the last
Congress and Kevin McCarthy had made it
a point to try to start U bringing our
members up to speed on issues
surrounding AI he saw a lot of that
coming down the track uh but we as we
started getting into it we realized
quickly uh how fast things were coming
online from the private sector and
really how far behind Congress was so a
component of this task force is to try
to get uh the base level knowledge up of
AI among members of Congress uh to kind
of cross-pollinate with members of
different committees and on our task
force we represent all the different uh
Committees of Congress and then trying
to figure out where's that where's the
right spot for Congress to fit in and uh
you know I had a we we've we've had an
opportunity to meet with industry
experts from all different aspects and
hear their perspectives and what we
continue to hear is Congress needs to
step in and do something here we're not
exactly sure where the sweet spot is
between over regulating versus providing
the right guard rails and bumpers but if
there's any group out there Congress has
a role to play in that in fact um you
know one of our early speakers had told
us that listen in private Enterprise our
job in a capitalist Society is to try to
push the boundaries we need someone to
give us uh you know tell us where we've
got to put the brakes on and that they
see and plus with congress's ability to
lead uh throughout the world other
nations are going to be looking to the
US for cues as to how we're going about
approaching this so Congress is the
place that probably ought to uh
originate from or at least be a a
convenor of all the smart people who are
bringing the ideas to the table so
that's that was kind of where we are and
uh so our next step is our task force is
um has um been given a homework
assignment to produce a report before
the end of the year which we will do and
that's going to give feedback on what
we've gleaned over these last eight
months or so as well as some uh
recommendations as we get started on
what we're calling sort of lwh hanging
fruit on some early uh legislation we
can try to put forth and then just
knowing where we've got to go in the
next Congress but this is not a
oneandone kind of evolution and we
obviously want to see this continue have
a standing role well I think you made
some very important points um um so
Congressman one of the questions that
came um to us was that uh members of
Congress in the same day have to deal
with Ukraine Hamas border security it's
like we kind of expect you to be an
expert on almost every aspect but I
think you said in the task force um that
some of it is education what steps do
you think uh can Congress take and maybe
it is doing so in understanding and also
improving its expertise in AI as it
works on this very very important uh
regulation and the other question is you
talked about bringing different
stakeholders in there are you also
bringing small businesses and those
kinds of voices or is it just going to
be these large Tech firms are you
bringing in agricultural colleges
community colleges because uh Stanford
uh MIT are great institutions we've had
their leaders here but 40% of our kids
get educated in community colleges too
so absolutely yeah now that we we've
recognized that as a group early on that
uh that there's a there are a lot of
voices that need to have a seat that's
table and that we're going to be uh
foregoing a lot of opportunity for
Innovation if we don't include the
smaller uh groups in there and that's
that's why we've uh done some
initiatives already to try to you know
democratize AI we've talked about with
the create AI act we're doing U some
Grant programs with Educational Systems
um I've I've had money appropriated
already for some of our universi ities
to look at AI specifically in the
agricultural space but um we recognize
that that when we say whole of
government it's not it's not Congress
and and the big boys out there this is
really is truly an entire whole of
government including uh all the smaller
businesses no that's good uh I think our
audience uh a lot of them are small
businesses uh entrepreneurs will be glad
to hear that and we had the uh director
of the National Science Foundation also
here on the podcast and he talked about
about how they're doing uh Outreach to
community colleges in they're doing
Outreach to agricultural institutions so
um I think that's a very important step
uh Congressman there is uh an issue
where because maybe uh the legislation
the federal legislation has not come up
States like California Connecticut have
now got legislation in there they said
they can't wait for um
Washington according to them to get its
so to speak act together but uh what
role do you think State should play in
AI regulation and uh what can we do to
avoid Patchwork of uh these regulations
because think about businesses large
businesses can afford large law lawyers
who can navigate through this but if you
are two people in a garage trying to say
I'm going to deal with California in
this way Connecticut in this way and
then EU Act in this way it's a little
difficult so your thoughts uh
Congressman on that no that is a concern
and we discussed that in many of our
meetings uh you know there is a a role
the states are going to be the
Laboratories and the incubators for
ideas out there but technology doesn't
know those boundaries that that doesn't
stop at state lines so we do have to be
very uh careful to not get so far behind
the states that um that we do have this
Patchwork but you know we've tried to
decide uh I think where we've landed as
a group that we really need to start we
need to provide the framework and the
modeling out there around standards for
AI and the enforcement will come later
the EU in my view and our view I think
collectively as a committee the EU kind
of got out a little heavy on the
enforcement side of things before the
standards and I think we need to put
some of those markers in place and and
then just recognize that this is going
to be an iterative process uh we can't
sit back and wait for one Global
complete solution to how the US
government is going to uh regulate AI I
think we need to put down some markers
and then just and then work with
industry and uh and evolve on the Fly
because that's how this is the only way
I think it's going to work we're either
gonna get nothing done and be stuck at
the starting line or we're going to go
too heavy-handed without fully
understanding what we're getting into
and it is a pretty complicated topic it
is it is and uh Congressman obber says
it'll be
incremental um you know uh uh
legislation it's not going to be
comprehensive so
uh I think you are uh reemphasizing that
uh Point Congressman uh in the past uh
you know the technological revolutions
when you look at the internet cloud and
some of a lot of other things have been
uh dominated or in funded by you know
the the government per se but you talked
about how the private sector is now kind
of leading this a Innovation should this
shift or uh influence
uh in our approach to AI governance in
some way well I think we've seen that
trending for a while and I think a lot
of that is private industry's response
to just the slowness of of government
we've become so bureaucratic uh so heavy
in regulation and internal processes
about creating processes that we just
can't seem to get out of our own way as
a government we've seen this uh you know
great case in point with the with the
space industry now and how the private
sector has stepped in and done things
that arguably you know absent you know
groups like SpaceX and and others the
federal government may have taken
another 50 years to do some of these
things if ever so I think um private
side moves definitely more nimbly than
than the government now and uh you know
I think the days of all these great
ideas emanating from government and then
and then private coming in to fill the
void I think we flip that model on its
head and I think we need to continue
that with AI as well well that's uh good
to know
um Congressman you also introduced uh
legislation to support uh American
businesses uh in terms of participating
in establishing Global AI standards can
you uh talk about why is it crucial for
this to happen well it's interesting as
we had topics from different sectors
regarding AI over the course of these
months the one thing that our expert
Witnesses would come back to in almost
every single hearing was the role of
standards and really how nist needed to
step in and play a a vital role we've
we've now tasked nist with so many
things I think that are going to be
coming out of this we're certainly going
to have to increase their budget but I
think that's where uh the private sector
is looking to government for the most
help like tell us what the tell us the
rules of the road give us the standards
and then then we can adapt and and work
within that so I do think that at this
point in the evolution of of AI I think
that's one of the areas the federal
government can help the most is to help
establish those rules of the road with
the standards so the rules of the roads
and the standard um uh Congressman there
has been a lot of talk about the impact
of uh AI on the job market on one hand
people say um you know there could be
potential job losses on the other hand
it talks about productivity uh gains
Etc but in sectors like agriculture
which is something you know a lot about
where labor shortages are a major
concern what are your thoughts on the
potential impact of AI on the job market
there well I think AI is going to be
transformational and I've heard folks
say you know compare it to being the
biggest thing literally since
electricity and I I've always been a a
science and technology Optimist I I look
for the good things that are come from
science and technology and sure there's
there's two sides to every coin course
but you know we we've we've endured and
made it through these types of
transformations in our history you know
if you were if you're in the 1890s and
you're a blacksmith or a buggy whip
maker you know there was there were some
storm clouds on the horizon you know if
you were a candlemaker before
electricity uh we we adapt and overcome
and I have great confidence in the
American people to be able to do that
but uh I I think it's going to require
some U some some very careful thought
and consideration on retraining of
workforces but I don't see things going
away and being completely eliminated I
think um in
every realm we have in society now
there's so much information and data
flowing at people how do we process that
how do we arrive at decisions I don't
see people humans coming out of the loop
in many of these places in fact where I
hear more often than not is our our
people that we have just need more time
to be able to do the value added let let
the machine crunch the data provide the
the solutions there that people can then
communicate person to person uh in the
area of agriculture you're right we we
struggle with labor shortages and that's
a tremendous opportunity for AI to come
in and and help pick crops make a lot of
decisions we're already now with um Ai
and drone technology we're able to do
things with um you know with with
fertilizing our crops with water with
with doing analysis down to the the
individual plant level that we could
have never done before and so we're
we're getting tremendous uh uh increases
in efficiency it's saving money it's
better for the environment and uh and
we're doing it in a way that requires
less labor that we already struggle with
to provide to begin with so it has got a
trans you know because uh we have a lot
of guests who come in and talk about how
AI is going to is changing healthc care
how AI is changing education but we are
really lucky that you come in bringing
that agriculture uh which is a very core
Foundation of you know everything we do
and you're saying that it could have a
real transformative impact in
agriculture also right congressman yeah
I it you know there isn't a single
committee we have in Congress and and
Congress has a committee to cover just
about every aspect of human life uh that
AI doesn't have tremendous promise for
and I think a is part of that you know
and I also serve on the Science bace and
Technology committee we've talked about
space But even as far as like weather
goes I'm an oceanography major in the
past and and um you know there it's hard
to imagine a more
complicated uh problem set than
predicting weather and if we're able to
do that better this is not going to put
weather forecasters out of work it's
going to give them the ability to make
better informed decisions in a more
timely manner they can impact and save
lives you know that's uh as a Floridian
uh you know hurricanes are are the bane
of our existence there I mean there a
struggle every single year and if we can
get better and do that better productive
modeling uh we'll do a much better job
to help and save lives same thing even
in the my insurance career before if we
can help do better underwriting then
then ultimately that will enable people
to to to pay less on their premiums we
can better predict the the risk that are
out there and the and uh help mitigate
some of the damages from them so I see
this helping in in every aspect that we
have yeah so what you're saying uh
Congressman for a guess is weather
forecasting which also has an serious
implication from in agriculture besides
us stepping out uh for work and things
like that is going to have big impact um
and you know other things like you said
almost everything that we do uh is going
to make a big big difference um
Congressman you had uh introduced this
uh land grant research prioritization
act to enhance AI research in
agriculture how do you think uh this act
can bridge the gap between Academia and
practical applications in farming well
and we're already seeing that in my home
state of Florida and then some some of
the grant money we've been able to
assist the University of Florida in
getting with their agricultural research
program they're working hand inand with
Farmers to help uh you know use AI to do
better things working towards models of
being able to to pick crops uh to be
able toh figure out how to better
optimize uh the land that they have so
um there's a lot of great things coming
down the line in that but it's an
expensive process and this is where I
think the the government and and private
side and the educational institutions
can work together well that's uh great
uh Congressman you know you talked about
every aspect of congress's uh or our
lives are impacted by AI you also said
on the veteran affairs committee and
it's a you know taking care of our
veterans is a very very important thing
do you think AI can have uh a beneficial
uh impact on Veterans too oh absolutely
in fact just this past week we had a an
oversight hearing regarding uh
disability claims and how those are
assessed and you know our um our folks
who work in the Veterans Administration
are overwhelmed with the amount of case
load that they have the ability for AI
to go in and and and scan a veteran's
entire medical history pull out all the
relevant information for a claims uh
decision maker or someone who's deciding
on the uh insurability there or or what
benefits are available uh it will just
accelerate that process enable them to
make better informed decisions and again
this is where this isn't going to
replace the human in the loop but it's
going to it's going to allow people to
not have to do the mundane repetitive
the types of things where mistakes can
be made and that over time uh the AI can
provide a a I think a better more
predictable uh output and then the human
in the loop can assess that and make the
proper decisions and then communicate
that person to person that's true um
Congressman uh as you know we've had
some major hacking that's happened on
our data uh by in some cases external
forces uh you know uh our social
security numbers and others that have
gone on do you think what role do you
think AI has uh on cyber security from
whether it's in defense offense what are
your perspectives on well again like all
of these aspects of of AI there's
there's both sides of the coin and we
have to realize that AI is is already
now being utilized and manipulated by
adversaries those who would either
foreign adversaries to the US or those
with Criminal Intent but on the on the
positive side we're using that as a good
offense as well so I think uh cyber
security and AI are going to go hand
inand there's a greater role for that
and obviously as as things get more
complicated it's you know there's
there's more data there's more Computing
uh requirements and there's more
electricity required so there's the the
the needs of the the AI machine are
going to continue to
grow yeah you talked about the needs for
electricity uh Congressman um as you
know that's become topic dour lot you
know uh surprisingly a lot of nuclear
power plants are coming back that uh I
just uh read that even the three m
Island uh nuclear uh plant is coming
back uh yeah who would have thought
Microsoft be getting in the nuclear
power plant
which is uh stunning if not anything
else in terms of uh this uh the use of
energy and uh you know how it is being
used for data
centers what are your perspectives I
mean we we have an abundance I mean if
we use you know the different aspects
whether it's nuclear uh you know
renewable and others uh obviously
there's a big need for this that's why
they getting into nuclear what are your
thoughts in terms of the use of energy
for keeping us at The Cutting Edge of AI
well it's interesting we had a gentleman
address our committee a couple of weeks
ago who said you know when when you look
at the the three primary components of
data uh Computing capability and
capacity and electricity Far and Away
the long pole in the tent that from his
perspective is is electricity and um I
think in fact he went on to say what
Private Industry doesn't really need is
just Congress throwing showering
everyone with money what we really need
is a better Energy Regulatory framework
we're really dealing with an an an
energy framework that dates back to the
40s and 50s that needs to be updated to
reflect the realities of today and this
also just underscores that our Energy
Solutions are going to be not an and or
an or I mean it's it's not an or
situation but but an all of the above
and um you know I think
there's a great place in our energy
makeup now for Renewal Renewables but
wind Mills and solar aren't going to
power artificial intelligence um so I
think it's uh nuclear is going to make a
comeback but we've got to provide an
easier way for that to come online
obviously maintaining the safety
standards that we have but but it can't
be so hard to get a nuclear reactor
going here in the 21st century yeah
that's so true um Congressman you
expressed some level of skep CRI ISM
about fully autonomous AI in defense
applications uh where do you draw the
line on ai's role in uh military
decision making as you know in Ukraine a
lot of AI uh is being used uh in that
war zone right now well I the dod is
still committed and and we are firmly in
support of maintaining a human in the
loop and those decision processes I
don't want to see weapon systems go
fully autonomous without a human in the
loop um and I think as far as uh you
know AGI is concerned I think we're a
long ways from that uh it was expressed
to me recently and I think it's it kind
of puts in perspective that uh if I
understand correctly chat GPT current
version takes about a gigawatt of power
uh to operate the human brain has
trillions of synapses and neurons
operating on 17 watts of power so we've
got a long way to go before our AI is
going to approach and and equal what the
human brain can do with the power
because again power is going to be the
limiting factor there we can create
great AI uh the computers and we can
have the data we're not going to have
the energy that can do that until we
find different efficiencies so I I think
it'll happen at some point but uh not
anytime soon but but uh in any case we
need to always maintain a human in the
loop so maintaining the human in the
loop especially for military
applications that kind of uh leads to
this perspective where you have
expressed some concern about potential
you know bias and AI algorithms uh what
steps uh Congressman do you believe are
necessary to address this issue well
that's always going to be a concern but
it's not something that's necessarily
being created by AI we've had predictive
modeling in different uh Realms before
and we always have to watch whether it's
you know how Consumer loans are approved
or how underwriting decisions are made
or how you know PE anytime that we'
we've used uh large amounts of
information we've got to look at at uh
you know what goes into that
decision-making process and I think this
is the same it's it's it's easy to
vilify the AI and say it's ai's fault I
think it all depends on who who sets it
up and I think that's where we have to
have those standards there needs to be
some transparency involved and I don't
think we need to give a a card blanch to
to people to say well this is
proprietary you can't look under the
hood I think when we're going to have to
make some decisions on the types of
things that we say you know what we get
that and whether it's you know the
government with with NDA that allow them
to get in to see what's what is under
the hood of these algorithms we're going
to have to do that to ensure that the
public has confidence that that uh there
isn't that sort of bias in yeah so some
kind of red teaming looking at uh the
explanation of these uh models uh
Congressman AI is moving at a very fast
speed you talked about AGI you know we
have multimodal we have uh agents and
things like that but rightfully so
Congress kind of moves at its own space
regulation policy moves at its own spa
space how uh do we um kind of keep that
going even if you came up with some kind
of uh regulation legislation if things
change so rapidly how do we uh kind of
keep that
going well I think as as I mentioned
before with uh with speaker McCarthy
before kind of getting this going we we
need to keep a Cadre uh in Congress
that's ramped up on what's going on and
that's why we we wanted to do this
across all the the different Committees
of jurisdiction uh we're already there's
there's been some talk of of this
transitioning from a a task force to
maybe a select standing committee so
that we don't work as much in silos I I
think we need to prove some worth first
we've talked about that as our task
force let's get our report out there um
you know get that out amongst our
members talk talk about it uh start
continue to build the the base level of
knowledge out there but um we I I don't
think as Congress we can afford to allow
each individual committees to run only
as fast as the specific knowledge of a
couple members within that group on AI I
think we need to we need to share ideas
and best practices across the different
committees and whether that ends up
being the form of a of a standing select
committee uh that remains to be seen we
got to demonstrate some value first so
spread the wealth around I think is what
you're saying uh congressman and get
people up to speed uh Congressman
finally uh you know when you look ahead
what do you believe should be the key
priorities for AI regulation in the next
5 to 10 years even though it's hard to
predict uh well forget predicting five
years it's hard to predict next 3 years
two years six months so just take a shot
what should be the future priorities for
AI regulation if you were to advise and
a lot of people are listening here to
you or your colleagues uh tin tanks and
European members of parliament so what
would you suggest to them uh I am
concerned about um data privacy we we as
Congress have got to get our arms around
something that we all we all recognize
the need that's something we've got to
figure out how to get pushed through and
out uh I think that's an important uh
piece to protect the consumer I think we
have to get these uh standards
established so that we give uh private
sector the guidelines under which they
can operate and feel confident investing
in capital and knowing that things
aren't going to be taken away um but
also on the flip side of that I I have
some concern about
um about companies that become too big
you know I I'm worried that if if you
have companies that have the ability to
control the data to control the
Computing capacity and have electricity
have the power to do it which we're now
already seeing with with computer
companies buying uh nuclear facilities
uh I think that has the potential to
create the most powerful companies that
have ever existed in the history of
mankind that concerns me you know there
was I I'm I'm a conservative I'm a
capitalist but I also know that there
are limits on on how far we should allow
things to go and you there was a time in
this country when we uh we broke up the
phone company and there was a lot of
angst around that but I would say that
we have the choices in uh in Mobile
technology today that as a result of
that so we're going to have to be
careful to not allow that kind of power
to concentrate in the hands of one or
two or three companies and and if we do
that not only is is there huge potential
for that to be exploited but it will
also crowd out all the innovation of the
small people that should have a voice at
the table in this because I think if if
that's if if we if we don't protect that
then we're going to lose a lot of opport
I think you made some uh very important
points for our listeners you said um you
know uh data privacy is very important
you said standards are very important
and then concentration of power now
that's a question we get a lot from our
listeners when you look at social media
you know our town hall in many cases is
controlled by a small group of companies
that can kind of control how we consume
news or things
but AI is even more uh transformative
and the kind of Investments that are
needed are can be only done by handful
of companies as you said some of them
are buying up new nuclear
power what can Congress do uh so that we
don't see a repeat of social media or as
you said that uh when we had the Mel
companies that we broke up uh so that we
are proactive rather than reactive of on
something like this well well I think
with um initiatives that we have such as
the the N the national AI research
resource um the the things that we're
trying to do to bring small business
into it we we want to get all of the
players at all sizes at the table now uh
having a voice and and as we set these
standards and grow going forward if if
this is again back to your Patchwork
question if if there's a if Congress
leaves a a void and a vacuum and doesn't
step forward and put some mark down and
they're going to be filled with things
that are going to be harder to fix uh
later on down the road no but I think
you made some good points n which gives
you know access to anybody and everybody
uh to compute resources uh that has been
set up I think also Congressman open-
Source technology which you know gives
people uh access to that so and you know
uh the innovation of the American uh you
know entrepreneur uh I have lot of faith
that many times there have been
companies that have come out of nowhere
will disrupt large companies so you know
I think hopefully that'll continue to
happen but I want to thank you
Congressman Franklin for sharing your uh
amazing insights on AI regulation and
your you know perspective from the
intersection of Technology Agriculture
and policy making really offers valuable
Food For Thought uh for our listeners
and as AI continues to evolve the need
