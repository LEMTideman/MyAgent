technology as its own sector which is
some people talk about tech as just kind
of its own industry technology touches
everything we do it touches every sector
of our economy and so I do think that we
all need to make sure we're keeping that
in the way that we expect it to what are
our goals with policy to protect
sensitive personal information are we
able to do that what do we need to put
in place what's the what are the rules
what's the enforcement mechanism how
does this work a data privacy bill
doesn't necessarily alone ensure that
outcome but it is important because we
have a better sense of where data is
coming from um what's being collected
how it's used um and in a sense the
Integrity of that data who are in many
cases trying to do the right thing know
what the right thing is and are actually
doing it to build that trust um out in
our communities and then also making
sure that there are consequences for Bad
actors moving and leading the way we're
the innovators as you said we are global
leaders uh we need to be global leaders
in policy
too welcome to the regulating AI podcast
join host Sanjay purri as he explores
the dynamic and developing world of
artificial intelligence governance each
episode features deep Dives with global
leaders at the Forefront of regulating
AI responsibly tackling the challenges
using AI can bring about head-on and
enabling balance without hindering
innovation
[Music]
welcome to regulating AI the podcast
dedicated to exploring the intricate
world of artificial intelligence
regulation I'm your host Sanjay Puri and
today we have the honor of Hosting
congresswoman Susan Deli from
Washington's first congressional
district congresswoman brings a wealth
of experience to the conversation with a
background as a very successful
technology entrepreneur and business
leader her insights into the
intersection of Technology policy and
regulation will undoubtedly shed light
on the complexities of shaping a fair AI
regulatory framework congresswoman thank
you so much for joining us today um
thank you so much for having me um this
is an important area to talk about
wonderful uh Congress woman we have a
global audience uh our audience is made
up of members of Congress their staff
think tanks uh Tech CEOs and people who
practice AI around the world uh so can
you for their benefit share your
personal journey and background that led
you to become a champion for online
privacy and responsible AI well um first
I had a long career before coming to
Congress in the technology industry and
also um with startups um in fact I never
thought I would run for Congress uh I
ran for congress because I uh grew up in
a family that had a lot of challenges
Financial challenges in particular and
felt like it was important that we do
everything possible to make sure that
people had access to opportunity
especially in a world that was changing
quickly and changing quickly um in a lot
of ways because of technology so um
after my career in technology I got
involved in policy and got frustrated
with policy and wanted to make a
difference so like any good entrepreneur
I jumped in to try to make a difference
and
um ran for office and so here I am I
think that technology is critically
important and I one thing I'll probably
highlight this many times in our
conversation but it's not just techn
technology as its own sector which as
some people talk about tech as just kind
of its own industry technology touches
everything we do it touches every sector
of our economy and so I do think that we
all need to make sure we're keeping that
lens as part of how we view the issues
that we face in policy and be thoughtful
about technology impacts and how that's
changing the way we work the way we live
the way we communicate um and these are
incredible opportunities and challenges
for
us I think uh Congress when you said it
right uh uh technology touches almost
everything whether you drive through a
McDonald's or you're working on a
factory floor or you're working in a
high-tech company it's not the Googles
of the world who are just doing
technology I think we are doing
technology as we speak right now using
this online Forum uh but I think it's
great that we have people with your uh
background congresswoman because you
understand the the implications of
Technology especially when such a
transformative technology is in front of
us and the regulations that are going to
and some of the things that we're going
to really talk about it what are uh you
know you recently uh did an p in use we
can you emphasize the importance of a
national Privacy Law as the foundation
of effective AI regulation can you
expand on why privacy is the fundamental
building block for this regulatory
framework uh
congresswoman well um absolutely AI is
fed by data lots and lots and lots of
data and um when we talk about kind of
how AI functions what the kind of
results are and um responses are that
come out of AI That's Based on data and
you know chat GPT was trained on 45
terabytes of data um you know I always
kind of try to help people think in
terms of uh what that might mean you
know over 200 days worth of HD
video uh just the immense quantity of
data but if we have um data that is
acquired in ways that were that it
shouldn't have been um that is uh that
um contains sensitive personal
information uh that really when we talk
about foundations that's the
foundational element that AI sits on top
of if we have challenges with our data
um and the Integrity of our data then
that's going
to make us all question and be concerned
about kind of what the outcome is from
AI too so I've been a strong supporter
for long long time since I came to
for a National Consumer data privacy
standard um we need people to be able to
be in control of their data uh we need
to make sure that um that it's clear
where data comes from right now ai
developers don't need to disclose where
their data you know might be coming from
um we need to make sure that data that's
protected is protected and uh and also
make sure that people aren't storing or
selling personal data
especially without any permission to do
so so we've seen you know other EU has
worked on data privacy legislation gdpr
but we really we a few states in the US
have moved on privacy legislation but we
need a federal law um we need a
consistent standard we don't really have
a seat at the international table on
these issues if we don't have a domestic
standard and that's going to be true
probably on everything that we talk
about why domestic policy is going to
going to be important here but um but
it's also the first piece it's the
foundational piece that we need to build
on top
of so it is the first piece it's the
foundational piece uh congresswoman why
has it been so hard for the United
States you you've seen the gdpr has been
out there for some time what challenges
do you see for us as you said some
states have done it uh you worked for
companies certainty is a very important
thing for companies to know rather than
a patchwork of things that they have to
deal with so tell our audience why has
it been so hard for us to have something
going um well you know first of all I
think the biggest challenge at the
beginning has been um in an area where
folks don't feel like they really quite
understand it putting together policy
together especially the first version of
a policy uh is presents a high bar folks
don't want to move something forward in
fact I think the tendency and I probably
everyone relates to this there's always
a tendency to do
nothing um as opposed to to do something
especially something where you're not
sure and it's in an area where you may
not understand it as deeply or
understand um what the long-term
implications might be I think that when
and that's true for privacy but that's
going to probably be true for a lot of
Technology policy that we look at we
have to start and we're going to start
and we need to put
policies in place and then we need to
see what's working and what's not
working kind of the entrepreneurial
process what what's working what's not
working and adjust and keep policy up to
date and making sure that it's
delivering um I'm glad that there's kind
of a renewed focus on privacy and hope
that that's a step forward I don't think
partisanship has really been the issue
here I think it's just been um um hard
to get people to do take that first step
so taking that first step so let's just
say if that happens uh congresswoman how
would that help mitigate some of the
risks of bias discrimination in some of
the AI powered system especially as you
have seen in the facial recognition kind
of Technology
congresswoman so I think one um to
ensure that systems aren't
discriminatory and let's be clear they
the systems are built however they're
built they're you know people design
them um if they're B Based on data then
we need to make sure the data is
representative and that means having
diverse data sets and um and good old
testing um over and over to see if um we
detect or bies um to see where things
may or may not be working as they would
be expected to um and to understand why
that is um the the uh a National Data
privacy bill doesn't necessarily alone
ensure that outcome
but it is important because we have a
better sense of where data is coming
from what's being collected how it's
used um and in a sense the Integrity of
that data which will be hugely helpful
uh but these are where it's going to be
an ongoing and already is an ongoing
iterative process to make sure that
technology is working um the way
expected or that people are testing
various scenarios to see where there
might be gaps in technology um so all of
that needs to happen but again it's
sitting on top of a bunch of data and we
got to make sure that we have integrity
in that data having Integrity on that
data I think is a very important Point
uh congresswoman shifting to AI
regulation um you know uh we've had a
lot of your colleagues on the show and
the challenge they say is how do they
keep Pace with a technology that is
evolving so rapidly what role should uh
Congress play in setting the rules of
the road for AI uh regulation because
you've seen large language models
multimodal agents now people are talking
about AGI based on whatever uh how how
does regulation keep Pace um uh and what
is the role of Congress here
congresswoman well um we're behind I
think we all have to admit we're behind
and um one way we keep Pace as we get uh
in the game getting moving on important
policy like privacy um and um and we
need to really understand and start
setting the guard rails around the
development of Technologies you know we
when kind of in the early days uh of
computing um everything seemed like it
was a net positive and I think we have
seen more and more the the scenarios um
the very concerning scen scarios that
can happen when technology is used in a
way um that is either unexpected or D
intentionally damaging so it is
important that Congress plays a role
there in a variety of ways um we're
going to see our adver series continue
to develop and use AI so this becomes a
national security issue and uh and an
issue that's going to be critical as we
look at uh defense it's an issue in
terms of protecting um civil rights and
civil liberties it's an issue in terms
of also making sure that people's
personal information as we talked about
um is protected too so we need to ensure
that here at home AI is used in um the
positive and beneficial ways that it can
be and is not being used in the harmful
or discriminatory ways that it can be
and that that means guard rails um
understanding what what we can put in
policy or or even um kind of the
outcomes that we'd like to see um making
sure that we have enforcement in ways so
we can actually people know that
policies that put in place are going to
be enforced um one thing that I talk
about talked a lot about when it came to
privacy for example is audit to make
sure that people actually are protecting
data in the way they're supposed to not
just waiting till something bad happens
um so I think that's another area we
need to think of along these lines is
what can we do to learn to make sure
that folks who are in many cases trying
to do the right thing know what the
right thing is and are actually doing it
to build that trust um out in our
communities and then also making sure
that there are consequences for Bad
actors so there's the policy there's the
enforcement side that goes along with
that but you're right policy is slow
we're going to have to learn to be uh
more Nimble to keep up but you know I
keep going back but we got to get
started um then we can talk about
iterating and learning from that not
everything is about policy but um there
we can do kind of that large important
framework that Mak sure that we're
upholding the appropriate protections
and ensuring that uh all parties are
living up to those
expectations so um enforcement and
getting started soon I think those are
some of the key points that you're
making congresswoman uh you've been in
the world of technology startups Etc uh
there's this argument uh or this point
that comes across from a lot of our
guests whether it's Tech CEOs or policy
makers Innovation versus regulation
Innovation you know we always say the US
innovates EU the European Union
regulates how does one keep that balance
what are your thoughts on Innovation and
regulation well first um I think that
it's really important when we look at
any type of regulatory environment we
understand what our goals are and um
understand the impact any types of
regulations would have on innovators uh
you know I come from a background of
working on the Innovation side and
working on the business side and so I do
think it's really important in policy
and sometimes this gets left out that we
understand the impact of policy on the
ground uh there's theoretically kind of
ideas in policy that sound good but
could be um could actually create many
other problems um in trying to meet
their goal we also have the opportunity
to put policies in place that can also
Inspire and support Innovation so that
kind of constant back and forth dialogue
with
innovators with folks um who are
actually using technology and um in
various sectors and understand the
impacts that decisions we make would
have on not only how they develop
products or how they sell products I
think is really important because we
want to make sure that we understand the
impacts on the ground of any policy and
when we actually keep that in mind I
think we can put together policy that
meets the goals that we need even maybe
some narrow goals to start off um but uh
meets those goals and continues to
support and allow Innovation to thrive
as you said books in the you know in the
entrepreneurial community and the
business Community they want as much
certainty as they can get um they are in
a place that inherently has a lot of
risk um things don't always work that
way that they're expected but the more
we can provide um policy uh guidelines
the more folks know what they have to
keep in mind when they're developing and
um and that can be hugely helpful
also so you talked about certainty
so what do you think about International
cooperation congresswoman in terms of
Regulation the eui ACT is obviously now
uh uh passed the parliament it's moving
towards implementation we are still
trying to get things going but if you
are a large company that's working
globally uh you want some kind of a
harmonization or some kind of that I
don't have to I mean large companies can
have armies of law lawyers but small
companies can't so what are your
thoughts in terms of international
cooperation in terms of rules
regulations on
AI um well first of all we need to be
rule makers not rle takers and part of
that means that we have to be moving and
leading the way we're the innovators as
you said we are global leaders uh we
need to be global leaders in policy too
uh the EU has moved faster on privacy on
AI regulations um and they started with
privacy first back in 2016
um and have moved forward and we still
haven't taken that first step um others
aren't going to wait um the Chinese
government has moved quickly on AI um
although we should be alarmed about kind
of the protectionist and anti-democratic
way that they've proceeded so it is very
important that we have a seat at the
international table but it is hard to
have a seat at the international table
when we don't have domestic policy in
place when we don't haven't developed
our own point of view of what we want to
see so um if we are going to provide
that long-term Direction
internationally and that represents our
values I think it's critical for us to
develop that policy domestically um and
have a strong point of view of where we
stand of what we want to see and then we
have we can really talk
um with the International Community
about the direction um and how important
it is that we get there we're trying to
do both at the same time but I think we
are much more effective when we have
strong domestic policy in place so have
strong domestic policy in place lead
rather than follow uh Congressman that's
a a a great Point uh talking about uh
you know some of the issues uh regarding
the regulations how are the concerns of
marginalized communities and
underrepresented groups uh going to be
effectively Incorporated in some of the
AI policymaking process uh congresswoman
well um this is a a huge issue and
important issue that I think has to be
part of uh all the work going forward
ensuring that um diverse marginalized
communities have a seat at the table is
a critical First Step um we need to make
sure that voices are heard um not only
in the policymaking but also in the
development of AI because folks can say
you those simple those simple words did
you think about X um really help drive
forward kind of how products are
designed um written thought through kind
of those initial product specifications
are developed with a point of view even
starting there and making sure that um
there's a diverse point of view on the
goals of a product how they might be
used um and where there might be
intentional or unintentional biases that
are built in um that's going to be
critically important from the very
beginning of development all the way
through to um for the development of
product I should say and the development
of policy um all the way through to
finalizing that so um let's make sure
that we have a lot of people coming
together and talking and learning from
each other because I think that's the
way we can be the most
effective so talk to a lot of people so
that we can be most effective uh
addressing those concerns uh
congresswoman we uh when you look at
social media uh it's dominated by a few
companies are Town Halls as you know uh
whether it's 5 six 7 whatever the number
of companies at least uh dominate them
the fear is that there could be
something similar within AI because AI
is so you just talked about the the
terabytes of data it takes to train it
so it's the chips it's the resources the
people the data centers only large
companies to a large extent can afforded
what uh can we do to make sure we don't
repeat the example of the social media
and there are no monopolies for
AI well I think um you know Innovation
is key um and kind of as we were
discussing a bit earlier the making sure
that we have a strong Innovative
environment is important because that
next uh idea that is disruptive and kind
of U moves us forward
could be starting anywhere and and so we
need to make sure that also has a big
impact on um on new leaders new ways um
uh new types of Technologies new ways
about thinking of things and um and kind
of keeps everybody doing their best in
terms of thoughtful uh thoughtfully
moving forward versus kind of
monopolistic control and kind of
preventing in preventing any type of
innovation um so I think that's going to
be the ongoing work uh and we've seen a
lot in technology where small players
can be disruptive um I think actually
putting uh good policy in place can be
really helpful here because the folks
who can really be hurt the most in the
absence of policy but also or in the
presence of bad policy are the smaller
businesses the smaller players who you
know this is one reason on privacy I've
been so
um focused on um on federal policy
because if a small company has to live
up to the standards set by 50 different
states that all might be different they
may never even be able to get into the
market in most States because they just
the burden of just the regulatory
obligations would be too great if we can
make sure that we have whatever policies
are put in place allow even those small
players to have that certainty and
Clarity so that they can move forward it
allows them to be competitive also so I
actually think we can do a lot in policy
to help ensure uh that competitiveness
that ability for innovativ all across
the country um to continue to be
involved and engaged and um
and kind of prevent anything from being
de um dominated by any one particular
player but policy can also be hurtful
there which is why we have to be really
thoughtful um and in this case why I
think federal policy in a lot of cases
will be really
important so Federal policies would
really help uh create a Level Playing
Field uh congresswoman congresswoman uh
finally I wanted to ask a question which
we have asked to a lot of people here
there are all kinds of reports that talk
about that a major transformation in
employment is about to happen in our
society because of AI all kinds of
numbers you could take 20% 30% 40% Etc
uh
but some every expert says that
something is going to happen a major
does Congress have a role in making sure
our Workforce is ready because those are
not numbers those are families and those
are people so how do we make sure that
yes the companies have a responsibility
does Congress have a responsibility in
this too well um education is key and
I'd say starting at the very beginning
um we've got to support uh
education um Early Learning and make
sure that kids all across our country um
from every zip code across our country
are able to get uh the education and
learn the skills that are going to be
critical for whatever work they might do
going forward and we know that
technology is going to be part of pretty
much whatever they do we saw during
covid um communities in my region um a
huge technology region that I represent
and that some parts of our Comm
communities are in areas that don't have
Broadband or even good self service so
when it came to online learning we had
communities who had no opportunity there
so we thought think about making sure
that those we don't all we put the
skills make sure the skills are there in
our Workforce and that we make sure
those
opportunities um impact everyone across
our country it does come down to things
like broadband and access it does come
down to making sure that um folks all
have access to a great education um that
we think about integrating technology in
um even at in early learning because
it's going to be part of everything um
that someone does and um and it's
important that we think about it when we
are talking to Workforce and folks who
are making changes um moving into
different area in the workforce are
going through disruption education is
key to that too um apprenticeships and
the work that we do to help people be
trained so at the federal level it means
making sure that there's funding um
making sure that we have the
infrastructure in place throughout our
country um and it across the board that
means investment and really tracking to
see how we're doing and I also think
when we talk about diversity it's
important that um we have opportunities
for everyone I was recently at a a a new
robotics program in a middle school in
my district and it was great to see um
that all kids were participating and
exciting and maybe didn't even know how
much they were learning when they were
building the robot how much they were
learning a little bit about electronics
and uh and uh programming and so we know
the best experience uh is when you are
having fun and you're learning without
even knowing you're learning so there's
a huge role we can play at all levels of
government as part of that but across
our communities to make sure everyone
has those
opportunities I think those are great
points uh uh government providing some
funding infrastructure education is the
key and our community is also standing
up and making it fun for people to uh
learn uh and enjoy learning uh thank you
congresswoman uh really for sharing such
valuable insights on the complex issues
that are surrounding AI regulation your
you know perspective as a leader from
techn technology and public policy has
given our listeners a deeper
understanding of the challenges and
opportunities for shaping a fair and
Equitable AI regulatory framework so to
our audience stay tun tuned for more
engaging discussions on regulating AI as
we continue to explore the dynamic
landscape of artificial intelligence and
its impact on society until next time
I'm Sanjay Puri signing off
congresswoman this has been fantastic uh
we hope that you come back again thank
you so much for taking the time thanks
Sanjay thank you
