so the interesting thing about major
Pharma is they've been traditionally
very good at running clinical trials and
then commercializing drugs so you give
them a drug and they can test it and
commercialize it very well but the part
that they've struggled with more is
almost the first bit of getting the
Innovation to figure out which drug
should even be
tested welcome to the regulating AI
podcast join host Sanjay pury as he
explores the dynamic and developing
world of artificial intelligence
governance each episode features deep
Dives with global leaders at the
Forefront of regulating AI responsibly
tackling the challenges using AI can
bring about head-on and enabling balance
without hindering
[Music]
Innovation welcome to the regulating AI
podcast artificial intelligence AI
stands at the Forefront of technological
Revolution so how do we regulate it
without stifling Innovation our podcast
feature insights from various
perspectives we've had industry leaders
to government officials to leaders of
advocacy groups together they address
peral questions that are needed to
create practical and Equitable
legislation I'm very excited to have
Rafael townend with us today he's the
founder and CEO of atomic AI a machine
learning drug Discovery company he
received his PhD from Stanford
University he was also a forbs 30 under
30 I invited him on this show as we want
to have many different voices that can
create practical
legislation and AI can have a
revolutionary impact on drug Discovery
so we thought it would be great to have
Rafael with us today welcome Rafael it's
an absolute pleasure to have you on the
regulating AI
podcast it's a pleasure to be here
thanks for having me wonderful uh Rafael
our uh uh guests are basically members
of Congress staff think tanks industry
leaders advocacy leaders people around
the globe EU Etc can you provide our
listeners a brief overview of your
company's approach to drug Discovery
using machine learning a little bit
about your background too please of
course uh so at a high level my own
background is really at the intersection
of AI and biology uh you know I did my
PhD as you mentioned at Stanford
University really working at this
intersection I started actually working
on self-driving cars and computer vision
type applications but then pretty
rapidly pivoted to understanding the
shapes functions molecules to be able to
better design drugs to cure diseases
with significant unmet medical need you
know in terms of what Atomic does it was
really sort of a continuation of a lot
of my PhD at the end of it we ended up
publishing some work that was featured
on the cover of science around these AI
approaches for standing RNA and the
shape and function of RNA and that
really leads to what a lot of how I
describe a tame which is really that
we're at the intersection of two of
these big breakthroughs of the last
decade on the one hand as I'm sure many
of your uh viewers are familiar with we
have the AI sort of Revolution with
Technologies like chat GP demonstrating
the power be computational technology
but on the other we also have the RNA
Revolution with you know things like the
MRNA vaccines saving us from the depth
of the pandemic and so Atomic is really
combining these two revolutions together
create its own breakthrough at the
intersection of RNA and Ai and really
what we're doing is we're taking this
this R&D AI platform these big AI model
Foundation model trained on in-house
custom collected data of RNA to better
design Therapeutics that involve RNA and
so by doing so we can open up these new
directions for you know targeting RNA um
and going after diseases that were
previously
incurable well that's fantastic so
you've taken uh the best of AI and
you've taken the best of uh the medical
breakthrough that sort of saved us from
covid which is the RNA so uh that's
fantastic
uh Rafel how do you see artificial
intelligence democratizing drug
Discovery uh and what do you what impact
do you think it'll have on the
pharmaceutical industry because as you
know it there are all kinds of numbers
they say it takes a billion dollars to
produce a drug and it takes 15 years uh
you know with the phase one phase two
phase three trial so a handful of
companies like fiser and some of these
big companies can do it do you what tell
us about uh the impact that what you're
trying to do yeah I mean the key is
really trying to use these AI
Technologies to get to better drugs
cheaper and faster right that's really
the takeaway it gets better outcomes for
patients in a more efficient manner and
the way you do that with a lot of the AI
drug Discovery approaches that we're
building is you can use sort of
computational techniques to replace a
lot of the previously expensive sort of
in the lab experimental techniques that
you would use um to search through
potential drugs and find the ones that
are more potent more selective less
toxic Etc and so if you can do that you
can essentially Short Circuit the path
to getting to the clinic and go much
faster to going through your FDA
clinical trials and then on top of that
if you're getting to higher quality
medicines as well you reduce the failure
rate within the clinical trials as well
if you've got better drugs entering in
with a higher probability of success
that reduces the cost of those trials
and part of the reason the entire
process is so expensive as you say a
billion dollars to get a new drug is
because of that high failure rate you
know it's a very common to fail phase
two clinical trial so if the quality of
the medicines you're bringing in there
are increased that also significantly
reduces the overall burden there so
Rafael for our listeners to understand
we might not be uh biology experts it's
the quality of drugs that are coming
into pipeline that is going to improve
reduce the failure rate that's going to
reduce the cost and the timeline also
because it people say it takes 10 to 15
years for these clinical trial so is
that what uh what you're trying to do so
yes you're reducing the failure rate in
the clinical trials you're also reducing
the overall timeline for any given drug
that you're developing too um you know
there's a process when someone says it
can take 10 years that's including not
only the clinical trial piece right
which can take a significant amount of
time but the process by which you find a
drug to run in the clinical trials too
uh that piece is called the drug
Discovery process versus the part in the
clinical trials is called the drug
development process and so we can reduce
the failure rate in the development
process the clinical trials and we can
dramatically reduce the time in the drug
Discovery process um thereby sort of
really reducing that 10year time span um
that it usually takes to find a new
drug well that's fantastic uh yeah Rael
uh can you share some success story or
examples of how your technology has or
will accelerate this process like you're
talking
about yeah so a big breakthrough that
happened in the last few years is this
technology called Alpha fold um it's
it's it was named breakthrough of the
year in Science magazine in 2021 I to
say and this was actually the team at
Google at Google deep mine that
developed uh this highly accurate uh
method of folding proteins okay so it's
given a protein figuring out the 3D
Shape it folds up into is very important
to understand what it does um you know
it's almost too obvious in a way it's
like understanding the shape of a bike
is important telling you what it does
and if the wheels of the bike are in the
wrong place it's not going to do a very
good job of bringing you around and so
very similarly the shapes of molecules
are very important understanding what
they do and then when something's going
wrong understanding how to fix it now
the problem is finding the shapes of
proteins or RNA or any other molecule
through traditional means is very very
expensive um I'm talking it can take
years and it can take millions of
dollars um in fact a friend of mine his
entire PhD was solving the structure of
a single protein using uh using these
traditional techniques and so with AI
you can take this process that is
extremely expensive and timec consuming
and reduce it down a few seconds instead
so I'm talking going from years to
seconds to find the structure of a given
molecule and once you do that you can
better understand what's going on and
thereby design better drugs to modulate
disease um and so that's been see as
this big success now the on the the
catch is that the drug Discovery process
is a long one right even a fast scenario
still multiple years and so this
breakthrough is recent enough that we
haven't seen all the sort of Downstream
impacts of it but there's every day now
there's more Publications showing how
much of a difference it's making in
terms of our understanding of the
biology and the disease diseases that
we'd like to
Target well that's great um for patients
and consumers um Rafael from a consumer
standpoint how does your company ensure
transparency and accountability in the
algorithms and the processes that you're
using for drug discovery
now it's a great question um at a high
level you don't want to just blindly
trust the algorithms right the
algorithms are making predictions and
they can oftentimes be wrong and so you
still need to test the final predictions
you can search through a vast amount of
potential sort of brug space using your
algorithms and it'll make some
suggestions but you're not just going to
take those suggestions on blly safe you
must test them and so we not only sort
of provide that sort of transparency uh
terms of showing like what data we're
training on and what predictions we're
making but as well providing um you know
very clear sort of validation of what
the algorithms are outputting as
well so um you know the question
obviously that and we've had a lot of um
guests that come in on the podcast that
talk about how patient data is being
mined ingested uh by this AI
tell us how do you navigate the
intellectual property concerns and
ensure that the benefits of Aid driven
drug dis drug discovery which we doing
are accessible to you know a large range
of stakeholders including patients and
healthc care
providers yeah and that's an ongoing
discussion and I I'm not surprised that
it's been one that a number of your past
guests have also dived into um I would
say there's a couple different angles to
this um you sort of want to um make sure
that the outputs of your algorithms are
understandable to a wide swwa right
you're talking about Healthcare
practitioners you're talking about
patients if you're integrating you know
and this is seeking more Beyond AIC as
well but across AI for health care in
general you need to make sure that it's
auditable right um that you can
understand where these predictions are
coming from what's conforming those
predictions and you need to make sure
that that that the people using these
predictions uh deeply understand you
know where this is coming from and are
not misinterpreting that data because
that's another major danger is if you
for example blindly trust the
predictions of your AI algorithm without
the right sanity checks on there that
can very much lead you astray um and so
speaking again from a broad industry
perspective here um it's really about uh
this process of Education of educating
folks and making sure they understand
where these predictions are coming from
and what they
need so educating uh the stakeholders
towards this is very
importantl Fel you talked about the
industry in what ways can the industry
collaborate with uh Regulatory Agencies
like FDA to you know ensure that
compliance uh is there with existing
regulations but also you know Foster
Innovation and AI driven drug discovery
yes uh in many ways actually uh we're
fortunate to benefit from a fairly uh
well regulated industry already in the
drug Discovery Space you have the FDA
right and there's a very standardized
set of clinical trials that any new drug
molecule has to go through um and so
from that standpoint you're not uh short
circuiting that process you still have
to go through those same clinical trials
the same as everyone else it's just the
quality of what you're putting into that
Pipeline and the speed at which you're
getting to the entrance of that pipeline
is
increased and so in that way right we're
not proposing to you know go beyond the
FDA or anything in fact we you know
they're a very important stakeholder at
the table here and you know a lot of the
regulations that are in place are
Written in Blood frankly of they they're
not being there before and then major
issues are rising and so in a lot of
ways those guard rails are already in
place and it's really about what we you
know what are the drug molecules that
we're going to run through the
regulatory process that we're picking
out and so if you contrast that to other
spaces in AI which are much more you
know almost uh the Wild West in some
ways there's relatively fewer sort of
questions around regulation in the AI
for drug Discovery Space specifically
because of the pre-existing regulations
here so Rafel
AI overall but also the space that you
are in is moving so rapidly I mean you
know overall in AI you know you see
changes almost you know today Sora is
there you have multimodal agents Etc but
just the same thing in the uh drug
Discovery Space how can an agency like
FDA keep up with these things because
you need them also to be on the same
page as you if you said you won't get to
speed faster but uh they are The
Gatekeepers rightly so but they also
need to be educated so any thoughts on
that uh yes no it a lot of it comes down
to having the right dialogue with the
right people at the table um it's it's
impressive to me how many times you know
there's just a disconnect between
different parties that have very
different viewpoints that can be
resolved by you know sitting down really
trying to get at the heart of the matter
and so for example you know
I've seen if from the AI for drug
Discovery Space you know this is a
slightly different example but bringing
AI scientists together with biologists
it's very different perspectives but if
you bring these folks together and talk
it through you can actually uh get a
much better understanding of the both
the capabilities and limitations of
these kinds of AI algorithms and so very
similarly engaging with Regulators can
give you give The Regulators a better
sense of where you really need to be
paying attention and what the potential
dangers are as well as you know the AI
for drug Discovery folks a better
understanding of where regulator's
concerns are coming from and making sure
that they're addressing those front and
center as
well um so obviously they need to be uh
educated uh towards what's coming down
the pike um Rafael how do you ensure the
reliability and um reproducability of
results generated by your Aid driven
drug Discovery platform considering you
know the complex nature of biological
systems yes this comes back to one of
the earlier points which making which is
you really need to validate the
predictions in the lab still and so what
we've built is not just an AI but it's
really an AI integrated in with a wet
lab that can test what the AI is
predicting and do that in a fairly tight
cycle so that you can quickly feedback
into the AI what is working and what is
not and as well as as retest examples
that you might it might be more
questionable right if it was a bad
experiment um and so in this way you can
really build not just an AI but an AI
with a lab in the loop and uh and get at
uh what we really see is the future of
AI and biotech with which is not just
computational and not just biology but
the integration of AI and biology
together so if it's the integration then
what uh do you have collaboration and
knowledge sharing uh within the broader
uh scientific and AI communities do you
see collaborations and do you have any
strategies so that you can advance drug
Discovery uh efforts
faster yeah it's a bit of a Mixed Field
out there to be perfectly honest in drug
Discovery intellectual property is a
major piece of the value and so a lot of
companies try and approach it by keeping
everything as a trade secret or not
publishing a lot of what they're pushing
forward this sort of comes into a class
with a lot of the more what I describe
as Tech perspective which likes to be
much more open and you know upfront
about what's going on and so we've tried
to sort of straddle that line and in
fact publish the materials and put out
the materials that we think will be
beneficial to the broader field without
you know single-handedly giving away
what the biotech Community would
perceive as a critical sort of trade
secret uh aspect and so as an example we
recently put out a publication for an
RNA Foundation model that we released at
the end of last year called atom one uh
which really demonstrated a lot of the
potential power of this for the broader
biotech and pharmaceutical communities
and I think that kind of dual approach
of being considerate about what
intellectual property you're keeping
internally versus what can be shared and
help Advance the broader field is the
right way to do
this so balancing both uh Rael is what
you're saying um exactly yeah uh do you
engage with patient advocacy groups and
Healthcare professionals uh when to try
to ensure some of your uh drug Discovery
efforts are aligned with patient
needs uh so we definitely are engaging
at a broad level with you know where
there's significant unmet medical needs
in terms of engaging with specific
patient advocacy groups at this stage
we're a bit early stage to really be
doing that in complete uh you know in a
very complete type of way but our
interests are very much you know in
addressing unmet medical need and so you
can get that you can pull sort of
significant reports of where there are
sort of diseases uh that uh you know are
lacking in terms of treatments and we're
really trying to push forward and design
drugs that are not only sort of minor
improvements on what came before but are
also able to you know address and
significantly improve you know patient
life uh sir Rafel uh one of the big
concerns and a lot of our guests have
talked about when they come in is data
privacy and security when work when you
know your work one works with sensitive
medical and pharmaceutical data
especially in AI algorithms uh any
thoughts on how uh industry can address
this yeah especially when dealing with
patient data and again this is I think a
broader industry comment right um You
have to be very careful you know there's
existing regulations there like you know
like Hippa an example um and uh you have
to you know make sure that you're
engaging with the appropriate uh
regulations here when pushing forward
but on top of that there's specific
technological advances you can leverage
to help in this case right you can first
of all help sort of like anonymize parts
of this data and use these AI approaches
known as for example Federated learning
to sort of selectively Grant access to
the underlying data in a way that isn't
uh compromising uh privacy um on top of
that you know I mean on the security
side of things there's obvious benefits
there but on top of that um you really
need to implement sort of the
appropriate security protocols and that
is something that we already do at this
time to really ensure that we're not
suffering from any sort of unintended uh
data leaks as well the external
parties so anonymizing data and also
making sure that there is enough
Security in the data that those would be
the important things um from a you know
access and use stand point for a lot of
divorce users uh with varying levels of
technical expertise
uh any steps that the industry should be
taking uh because you know the people
have different levels of technical
experties everybody is not an AI expert
so as AI gets more integrated into
Health Systems what steps should be
taken
uhel uh clear documentation as to the
outputs of the AI algorithms and you
know what in what conditions we expect
it to work versus where are we do not
expect it to give useful answers and
then how to confirm or how that those
output should be validated another very
key aspect because most people obviously
are not AI experts as you say and so you
really need and I keep coming back to
this point the appropriate education of
the users before this can be used
appropriately on top of that you can put
in the some amount of guard rails around
the AI protes themselves and this is
sort of a responsibility uh such as
atomic and others of putting in those
guard whales in the first place um and a
key way of doing that is instead of you
know giving folks direct access to the
AI models it's instead providing the
outputs of the AI models and clear
explanations of what they mean because
if you provide the AI model directly
there's a lot more potential for
misunderstanding in misuse of those
models um versus if you're just dealing
with the outputs that's a more
constrained environment that is more
easily
controllable yeah uh Rafel you talked uh
several times about educating uh the
users whose responsibility is it how do
we educate uh the users because that's a
very important topic that keeps coming
up through many many
guess yes I mean in some ways a
significant part of that responsibility
uh falls to the folks that are building
these tools in the first place right so
I mean I would include Atomic within
that but I also say that from a fairly
self-interested perspective as well
right the more you can educate folks as
to the utility of these kind of tools
the more you can drive their adoption
their use um and then some ways that
therefore I see you know there's very
much an alignment of objectives here
which is you really want folks to
understand what these things can and
cannot do if that's the most effective
way that you're going to actually
leverage these tools for people's
benefit um it serves no one for a user
to misuse a tool uh um and cause issues
down the line that would just be I mean
bad press for the company you know
problematic for the users um lead to you
know further distress of AI as a
whole yeah so you're saying it's
basically own the company like an atomic
and on the user themselves too right yes
uh it's on the users as well obviously
you know there's no doubt about that um
as we're starting to talk about you know
AI regulation as well in terms of what
should be enforced and required of the
companies and the users it certainly
seems like there's room there as well
for regulating sort of the use of these
tools
specifically so uh you know you talked
about uh potential interface with the
FDA uh as you know AI is working more in
terms of drug uh Discovery how about uh
Global Regulators uh outside the US uh
where do you how do you see those
challenges because are they going to be
up to speed because you know you're not
people are not going to just Market well
maybe the us but it could be the EU it
could be UK it could be uh other parts
of the world so any thoughts on how we
can probably get some kind of uh
uniformity right um so there is a
patchwork of regulators across the globe
right we wouldn't be able you know if we
got approval from the FDA the market are
drug in the United States that wouldn't
mean that we automatically had approval
to do so in say Europe you'd have to go
through Europe's equivalent of the uh
FDA the EMA instead uh to really get
those approvals and you know there's no
denying that that's a whole separate
process at this point and that's sort of
a a un you know this is a challenge that
all drug Discovery companies face it's
how do we market and develop drugs
across different countries now when you
throw AI into the mix that further
complicates the picture because now
there's also separate AI regulation
that's coming into play and certainly
having a unified approach there uh could
be very beneficial in terms of
understanding how and when we should be
deploying these types of AI
algorithms now I I'm a firm believer
that really what you should be doing is
regulating the outputs of these
algorithms as opposed to the development
themselves of these tools um it sort of
I I can get into that further as needed
but it's really that's an easier uh
place to regulate in many ways and uh
leads I think to an ability to treat
these things a bit more uh uniformly as
well can you just give us a little more
detailed because our podcast is
regulating AI our listeners are members
of Congress and Senate and their staff
in many ways so uh tell them a little
bit about what you are saying is
regulate the output uh they're anxious
to
right of course um it's the way that I
like to think about this um and this
might be barring a little bit from
andreen who I you know I worked with in
the past as a TA back at Stanford um
it's you know AI fundamentally is a tool
it's it's a hammer right that can do
different things and uh really I think
it's such a fundamental piece of
technology that that regulating it self
for example in the drug Discovery Space
would probably mainly stifle Innovation
is my sense there versus if you regulate
instead of how it's used for example
prohibit its use for designing a
bioweapon as an example here that's just
a much more productive Way Forward I
mean like an analogy would be uh trying
to regulate electricity or something
or it's like the fundamental technology
has a lot of positive
and potential negatives there and it's
more about like making sure you're
clamping down on those negatives as
opposed to trying to throw out the
entire uh uh the entire technology
together and so for example there's been
these regulations around training these
big AI models uh for on biological
sequences and saying oh if you train on
above this amount of if you use more
than this number of floating Point
operations then you have to report it to
the US government
uh and let me tell you that there's
certain applications where you would
need far less than that to to be
problematic and there's certain where
you need far more than that to to have
anything problematic happen and really
even in those cases like take the
example designing a bioweapon the part
that the AI addresses is just one very
small piece of the puzzle and does not
make the overall process of developing a
bioweapon significantly Easier by any
means um and so maybe the broader point
that I'm making here is like AI is a
tool and it's really about how you use
that tool more than anything that it
really people should be paying attention
to so AI is a tool and you know the
output and should be the one that we
should be really concerned about uh
Rafel how does big farma look at folks
like you I mean because you know they've
had this this six seven 8 10 whatever
companies uh how do they look at uh
folks like you are fully trying to
disrupt everything that they stand
for it's actually fairly interesting
from their perspective they actually see
this as uh synergistic a bit of a
symbiosis I suppose really um yes so the
interesting thing about major Pharma is
they've been traditionally very good at
running clinical trials and then
commercializing drugs so you give them a
drug and they can T it and commercialize
it very well but the part that they've
struggled with more almost the first bit
of getting the Innovation to figure out
which drug should even be tested and
there's almost been this recognition
that they've outsourced The Innovation
to biotech such as atomic AI they're
using these new kind of Technologies to
find uh these new drug molecules right
as I was saying once you found the mo
Fields a very standard process of going
through the FDA and getting it approved
and that piece is relatively stable
we're actually not or Atomic at least is
not trying to disrupt that piece of the
puzzle um and so you know a major
pharmaceutical looks at a company like
Atomic and says hey this is a company
that can generate new drugs for us to
test we can license that from them we
can buy them if they're really
successful um it's not until later when
such a company become very successful
and starts becoming competitor in terms
of developing commercializing their own
drugs that they start becoming more
concerned um and that's certainly a risk
obviously but it's definitely not a
strict negative from them and they see a
lot of these new biotechs is actually a
very positive source of
innovation so they're thinking hey this
is another way maybe the these are an
R&D Outsource R&D for us in some ways
exactly exactly and if it works then
then they license it you know like the
biion tech fiser vaccine is a classic
example of this bi Tech developed the
initial vaccine fiser licensed it and
developed it and rest is history rest is
history that's true well we'll see what
uh amazing things uh come out uh there
um Rafael uh you've been very very kind
with so many different uh perspectives
and some of the amazing things you're
doing uh I've told you about our
audience some final remarks for our
audience because everybody says
healthare is the most important Frontier
for AI drug Discovery I've had members
of Congress coming in saying that hey
how we look at cancer in the next 5
years it's going to be very very
different and you are sitting right at
the cusp so tell our audience some
whatever your final thoughts words are
for us yeah I I certainly agree with a
lot of that sentiment I think AI is
really poised to disrupt a lot of the
process by which we're finding these
drugs and finding new medicines to
really improve and Save patients lives
and we want to be very considerate about
how we regulate this kind of thing um we
should regulate the specific uses of
these applications obviously no one
wants to develop a bioweapon or at least
certainly I hope most people don't want
to do that but you know if you start
putting clamps down on the fundamental
technology itself that will also slow
down our ability to get hos life-saving
medicines and so like many other uh
Technologies I think a very considerate
sort of thoughtful approach and a
balanced approach to this regulation is
very much
warranted a thoughtful and balanced
approach because some amazing things
will come out so we need to be careful
that we don't toore the baby with the
bath water uh Rafel this has been so uh
great thank you so much there are so
many other questions uh that I wanted to
ask but maybe we'll have you back again
so thank you for being such a wonderful
guest on our show ah thank you so much
