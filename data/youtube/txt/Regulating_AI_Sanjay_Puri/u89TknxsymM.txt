well you know that's a really good
question Sanjay because what for the
last couple of decades the the the
digital entrepreneurs have been saying
keep government out of my business and
all of a sudden U you have uh very
thoughtful people like uh like Sam mman
um and um and and like Brad Smith um and
Microsoft uh saying hey uh we got to do
something I think my favorite quote is
is uh is uh sudar pachai uh who said you
know AI is too important not to regulate
and too important not to regulate
well welcome to the regulating AI
podcast join host Sanjay pury as he
explores the dynamic and developing
world of artificial intelligence
governance each episode features deep
Dives with global leaders at the
Forefront of regulating AI responsibly
tackling the challenges using AI can
bring about head
and enabling balance without hindering
[Music]
Innovation welcome to the regulating AI
podcast artificial intelligence AI
stands at the Forefront of technological
Revolution so how do we regulate it
without stifling Innovation our podcast
features insights from various
perspectives we've had industry leaders
to government officials to leaders of
advocacy groups together they address
pivotal questions that are needed to
create fair and practical legislation
today we have a very special guest with
us today Tom wheeler who was the
chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission from 2013 to
2017 he's currently a visiting fellow in
governance studies at Brookings
institution and has been involved with
new telecommunications networks and
services for over four decades recently
Tom wrote a very thought-provoking piece
on AI regulation which we'll be
discussing today he also has a very
interesting book called techlash who
makes the rules in the digital Gilded
Age which I'm hoping to discuss with him
in another podcast Tom welcome to the
show hello Sanjay it's nice to be with
you great Tom uh our audience is global
uh we have members of congress senate
their staff industry leaders and policy
makers but also people who are you know
startups in the AI industry around the
world world so uh your recent piece uh
on Brookings highlighted some key
players in the AI industry calling for
regulation what do you think prompted
their shift in stance u in terms of
calling for this regulation
Tom well you know that's a really good
question sanay because what for the last
couple of decades the the the digital
entrepreneurs have been saying keep
government out of my business keep
government out of my business and all of
a sudden um you have uh very thoughtful
people like uh like Sam mman um and um
and and like Brad Smith um and Microsoft
uh saying hey uh we got to do something
I think my favorite quote is is uh is uh
sudar pachai uh who said you know AI is
too important not to regulate and too
important not to regulate
well and so the question
becomes why did they make that change
and I think there's only one answer
which is
self-interest I mean there's a there's a
and I and I don't mean that in a
negative kind of way we all we all acted
our self-interest it's just that that
self-interest is now being redefined I
mean I think one point is that is that
it
has somewhat of a calming effect on all
the frenzy of the impending apocalypse
if you will um saying hey relax you know
we can we can take care of this we can
figure out how to have some kind of
oversight and I think the other aspect
of it is that is that
it it begins to define the policy debate
so that instead of you know I'll meet
you at the front gate with my shotgun
it's come on in I recognize we need to
do something let's talk about how that's
done and and they get to
Define um the opening rounds of that
discussion so you know I think and and
and I was you know a longtime
practitioner if you will of representing
companies before the federal agencies
and and the con and I think it's a very
smart strategy on their
part so smart strategy as you said
they're take instead of going in with a
shortgun they're going in the friendly
way a lot of cynics uh and guests on our
show have said this is a strategy of
regulatory capture so that what happens
is uh let's say the new people people
who don't have the tremendous resources
are going to find that ladder harder and
harder they who don't have an army of
lawyer or experts uh do you think that
there could be some element of that so
you know I
always chuckle I'm not sure that's the
right word I I always when I heard hear
the term regulatory capture I kind of
shrug um because the ultimate regulatory
capture is to do
nothing right yeah and um and so I I
understand the concept of regulatory
capture I understand and and I hope
we'll be a have a chance to talk about
it it's one of my concerns um about the
licensing idea but the fact of the
matter is that oh there might be
regulatory capture is not a reason not
to have regulation and you need to deal
with it but you don't shouldn't run away
with regulation uh I mean against
regulation just because oh well there
may be some influence that the regulated
have on the
regulator so maybe it is there but we
still need to do something um coming to
a point you just touched on um you know
you mentioned licensing AI which was
originally proposed it was proposed by
Sam Alman in that original session that
you talked about the CEO of open AI uh
is not the answer according to you but
you said it in your paper it contains
the answers can you elaborate for our
listeners what do you mean by that sure
um so when I was chairman of the FCC I
was responsible for the federal
government's largest licensing program I
mean you know the federal government has
all kinds of Licensing program they
license grazing rights they license
drilling rights and I and and my
colleagues at the FCC
oversaw uh the licensing of the airwaves
of spectrum MH and um and it was a
terribly important thing
because if you have a free-for-all out
there and every anybody can go out and
broadcast me whatever they want without
any concern for other users then you get
nothing because everybody interferes
with everybody else so the federal
government says we will start
licensing
Spectrum um and deciding
this is who will be this television
station in this town this is who will be
the radio stations these are who will
get to use it for wireless telefony or
for for Wireless Communications Etc um
and
and what I learned from that
experience is that licensing is
inherently
anti-competitive and as a result
inherently anti
Innovative and that what you're doing is
you are giving a government
grant if not Monopoly at least of one of
a handful of users and saying you're the
only ones who can use that that asset
who can behave this way and that is an
incredibly
potent kind of of Grant and what it ends
up leading to
is it leads to Great economic
power which leads to Great political
power which brings us back to the topic
you were just discussing and that is
that that political power gets used
ultimately to what can I do to lessen
the
requirements um on uh on the license and
and and so that's that's one set of
problems it's also a very
blunt
instrument
um you you
can't
get uh specific about
behaviors inside a
license um you know basic things when it
came to Spectrum basic things like okay
what are we going to do about close
captioning for those who are hard of
hearing what are we going to do to make
sure that the antennas that go up um
aren't interfering with airplanes and uh
and and things like this there have to
be specific policies that follow along
with the licensing so what I said in
this Brookings piece that that you
referenced is that licensing is not the
approach to
take but there are a couple of
components that you have to
address in licensing that are good ideas
such as you got to figure out what the
responsibilities of a lensee
are and you got to enforce
them and and so what we need to be
thinking about
is what's the best way in which we can
establish technical standards behavioral
standards and enforce
them for AI
so you are saying there are certain
standards that need to be implemented uh
as you said there are some things in the
licensing that has value um and you draw
some parallels to Spectrum licensing but
Tom you also talk about how the
proliferation of open- source AI models
which you know meta has llama Mistral
now uh Gemini has done that and now
recently uh Elon said he's open source
groc you say how does a proliferation of
open- source AI models complicate the
idea of Licensing
AI well open
source sure does address the competition
issue that I was worried about and sure
does address The Innovation
issue the difficulty is
that how do you end up
licensing
overseeing two guys and a dog in a
garage in
Estonia and um and so um open source has
some great benefits to
it but the difficulty is how do you get
your arms
around uh the establishment of any
expectations for that and again I think
that
the idea of starting with big AI if you
will and
establishing technical
standards um red teams audits
transparency etc
etc um is a good idea I don't think you
need net licensing to do that but it's a
good
idea and um and and because of the fact
that the open source are essentially
derivative of those big activities
there's a trickle down effect if you
will into into open source um and and
that's that's beneficial but but my
Approach or my suggestion is
that one of the problems when we talk
about
AI in regulating
AI is that it is too massive a concept
it's a you know it's a so AI is
um AI is like the mythical uh Greek uh
Hydra monster right that had all these
multiple heads I mean it could it can
manifest itself in multiple ways and
each of those heads by the way ends up
being like uh
the um the Roman god with two
faces um and um and and so that's a both
positive and negative uh potential and
and and so what we need to be doing is
we need to be pursing
out our
consideration of AI okay let's break it
into what are we going to do about
technical expectations and then what are
we going to do
about behavioral
expectations um I wrote a book before
this before techlash thank you very much
for mentioning techlash um I wrote a
book before techlash called from
Gutenberg to Google the history of our
future um which if we're going to
continue my commercials here uh comes
out comes out in June uh in paperback uh
with a special uh addendum uh on AI
um but one of the takeaways of from
Gutenberg to
Google was that it is never the primary
technology that is
transformational but always the
secondary
effects and so as we parse out our
consideration of how to deal with AI yes
we need technical standards but then we
need to look at the effects of the
technology and begin to develop
behavioral standards for
that Tom when you say behavior and you
mentioned this a couple of times what do
you specifically mean by behavioral
standards for our audience well let's
let's let's take a couple of examples um
and and I think again you have to parse
the concept of Behavioral standards um
um the lwh hanging fruit here is um
things
which we Society has decided are bad in
an analog environment which are made
more
bad I was an English
major things that are made
worse um by AI or or exacerbated by AI
um we know that
fraud is illegal it doesn't doesn't
matter whether the fraud was perpetrated
by analog means or by digital means or
enhanced by AI it's illegal the same
with discrimination and other kinds of
wellestablished practices you know Lena
Khan the great uh chairwoman of the
Federal Trade Commission um had a great
explanation of this she she said she
said that there is no AI exemption in
existing law and so so the first effect
that we deal with is okay what are those
that we can deal with with existing
laws the second bucket if you
will
is more difficult and it's and it it it
deals with the fact
that for the last 20
years we've been sweeping under the
policy rug all of the issues brought
about by the digital
Revolution privacy what competition in a
digital Market is truth and trust and
these kinds of
things and it's time that we step up and
deal with
those because again AI only exacerbates
those
challenges and the fact that for 20
years we have ignored those challenges
puts us on the back foot if you will
when it comes to dealing with their AI
manifestations so if that's the second
bucket the third bucket then is the
unknown
unknowns
um we know you know sanj you and I can
sit here and look at each other and and
say we know that AI is going to develop
and deliver some incredible new things
that we haven't even imagined M and and
how are we going to deal with those how
do we
create an oversight structure that is
agile
enough to deal with what may be coming
down the line and and I'll tell you you
know as the former head of a federal
regulatory agency agility is not the
word that you use to describe those
situations so we need to bring a new way
of
thinking into this new
challenge um and um and and I think that
that's the way we we put our arms around
the effects of AI by again parsing them
into their various
components so Tom you said uh several
things that I want to follow up on very
very interesting things so I'll start
with the last last one and I'll work my
way uh up you said agility Tom and I
both live in Washington so agility is
the thing that never happens in this
town now as you said um AI is like the
Greek god Hydra it keeps evolving you
know every day there's something new we
have members of Congress who are now
tsed members of Congress and Senate who
are tasked with coming up with some
legislation we have an executive order
but some kind of legislation needs to
happen now obviously nothing big is
going to happen in this year but how do
and you are in a regulatory agency how
do members of
Congress create legislation for
something that's evolving so very fast
and I asked this to members of Congress
and they say it'll be an evolution it's
a challenge all kinds of other stuff
I've had M Senators come here and I
asked the same question you sat on the
other side as you said any thoughts
that's my first question and then I'll
come to others sure um we have a
representative
government um and if you were to walk
out on the street and ask the first six
people that you saw um what they thought
about large language models and the
oversight of it um you'd get a lot of
stares back at you you know it's
significant I
think that when the House of
Representatives in the last couple of
weeks went to put together a task force
AIT bipartisan task force yeah on AI
policy that it's it total 25 30 members
it total it was it was 5% of the members
of the House of Representatives who had
a working knowledge of the issue and um
and and that leads us and I don't say
that to fault them I was with a member
of the Senate yesterday who who at
noon was talking about the effect of
loneliness on some of the challenges
that we Face nationally and at dinner
was talking about uh Gaza and the uh uh
and the EU uh Ireland uh uh problems
with the the Border in Northern Ireland
it mean the job of a of a representative
or a senator is mindboggling in terms of
the the
breadth on which you are expected to
become
knowledgeable and that puts us in a
situation where
where we take 21st century
challenges and Define them in 20th
century terms
and propose 19th century
solutions that it that we always Define
tomorrow in terms of what we understand
today that's just human
nature so one of the challenges of
meaningful oversight for
AI is the
establishment of a functional structure
inside the federal government where
there is ongoing expertise
where the the the officials there wake
up in the morning and and look
themselves in the mirror and say what am
I going to do today about this issue and
are able to get quite specific um about
it and um but again I I have all the
respect in the world for these elected
representatives and the challenges they
they face but there's it's it important
to be able to say that we look to
somebody with some expertise to
help so um just to follow up uh because
that was one of the questions I had and
then I have few others to go back to
your earlier comments you said one of
the things you propos is a sub either
and I don't know if that's the exact
term a separate regulatory body or uh in
your paper Etc now I've asked this to
several members of Congress on our show
bipartisan they are not happening
because for a variety of reasons we live
in a very partisan area that's number
one and it's uh it'll add to bureaucracy
some say we already have agencies like
the FCC the FTC we have doj Etc and I
know this is something that you have
proposed and several others have
proposed what do you have to say to uh
some of our guests who say uh it's going
to be tough to create an agency
especially a new bureaucracy uh for
something like this and some of them
some of them will be listening to you
right now by the way sure sure well
let's let's let's start with the
basics that that I've got nothing but
the highest respect for these civil
servants um and and the job that they
are
doing um the difficulty is that they're
doing it based on
statutes and structures
and judicial
decisions that are based in the
industrial era okay so the Federal Trade
Commission as I said before lenina KH is
doing a great job as chair of the
Federal Trade Commission Federal Trade
Commission was created in
1914 and that's when its basic
operational statute came into being sure
it was modified along the way but it was
modified in terms of of industrial
Concepts the Federal Communications
Commission that I used to chair its
statute was created in
1934 television broadcasting didn't even
exist
then the Department of Justice to just
to mention the three that you that you
mentioned the Department of Justice is
is working on on um a an antitrust
statute that was written in 1890 and
another one in 1914
and um and the problem is that the
challenge faced
today in the digital era is different
from that that ever could have been
imagined in the industrial era and
that therefore an
agency is constrained in what it can do
there is a huge push um particularly
amongst Republicans
to keep agencies from discretionary
decision making there will be a big
Supreme Court case in a couple of months
on a concept called Chevron Defence
which is basically it's an 18 1986 um
Supreme Court case that in essence says
we have expert agencies for a reason
let's let them use their
expertise and um and the uh Republicans
are saying that's the Shadow government
that we need to shut down so so I you
know like I say I've got huge respect
for these people and I've got huge
respect for how they're trying to
shoehorn digital challenges into
industrial era statutes and structures
now in so far as do we have a Congress
that would pass this such legislation
well we don't have a Congress that can
pass a
budget um and and we kind of start there
however this concept for an expert
digital agency has been introduced um in
the Congress um Senator Michael Bennett
of of Colorado and Senator Peter Welch
of Vermont have both introduced it um
into that body um um Lindsey Graham and
Elizabeth Warren speaking of odd bed
fellows um have a similar
concept and the four of those senators
in a bipartisan group recently went to
leader Schumer and saying hey we need to
do something about this let's open up
the dialogue on how we get this done um
I am a I am a political pragmatist but
that also doesn't mean that you don't
say let's make sure that we got the
ideas out there and we have a fome
debate about
them and you've got your ideas and our
listeners are listening uh Tom I want to
uh clarify something which uh on open
source that you discussed are you for
open source or are you not because I was
you want
Innovation uh and um maybe less monoply
but obviously there are challenges so
would you say open source uh because
there are two camps right now as you
know open source closed Source uh where
do you come out on that I'm I'm Pro open
source as a as a source of competition
and Innovation that also needs to have
guard rails in place to oversee Its
Behavior and its
effects okay so open source with guard
drills uh one final question EU uh AI
act just went through Parliament I think
yesterday Etc they have taken just and
you talked about our privacy laws and
other stuff they've taken a lead as you
know in the issue of privacy now doing
something with uh you know the uh big
markets uh Etc uh American companies
will H if who are doing business in EU
will have to
comply uh are there lessons to be
learned from them by us Tom oh yes so so
you know Sanjay
the one of the tragedies I mean I'm I'm
a guy who loves history MH and one of
the tragedies of the the last couple of
decades in the digital
era is the United States has abrogated
its leadership
responsibility in developing policy as
Technologies evolve I mean never before
in the history of this
nation have we failed to develop a
policy in response to a new technology I
mean pick your poison
to go back and think through those
through through history but that's what
we've done for the last 20
years and and that has let foreign
governments fill the void and make the
rules it's also allowed state
governments to come in and fill the void
and make the rules both of which have
big problems so so if you've got if
you've got State a and state B and they
have slightly different nuances in their
the laws that they passed because
Congress hasn't done
something then you bulcan IE the
marketplace the domestic
Marketplace if you look at the situation
in the EU where they've had incredible
leadership um on digital platforms and
now as you point out just yesterday on
on a
I um in an interconnected
world where the companies need to enjoy
the scale economies that come from a
common Network delivering common
products and collecting common
information there's a forcing function
that says okay we've got to level things
out so that the the the rule that was
created over there in in Europe ends up
applying here the classic example of
that is the gdpr the Privacy Rule that
Europe put in place years
ago that has its faults but they did
something and when the state of
California and I think 16 other states
decided they wanted to pass their
Privacy
Law they based it on gdpr and when China
of all places did decided they wanted to
pass a Privacy Law they based it on gdpr
although with more power to the state um
but but the fact of the matter remains
that that I think that American
companies are going to uh end up being
in a situation where the rules under
which they operate if they want to enjoy
the scope and scale economies the
network effects that come from the
internet that they're going to have to
end
up obeying rules established by other
nations that prioritize those countries
needs rather than the United States and
how we might have our priorities and
that's probably another reason to go
back to your first question another
reason why the AI leadership um is
saying well we need to have our own
rules over here it is just um you know
tragic is a big word but the way in
which American policy makers for the
first time in history have walked away
from their responsibility to oversee a
new
technology and left it to others to
decide is tragic
uh you make a very interesting point
because even though you know we have
entrepreneurs who come in and say hey uh
us innovates Europe regulates but they
also but they also say we want
consistency because how can they plan a
business where as you said there's even
within States there's a patchwork of uh
rules and regulations uh Tom um Tom uh
you mentioned the concept cep of pirate
AI in your piece can you explain to our
listeners what that is and why it's a
concern to you well I was trying to draw
the analogy back to the FCC regulating
spectrum and and what we call Pirate
Radio which is I mean which you know
opening up a radio station is not
hard um I remember when I was chairman
we we shut down a station that was
nothing more than basic broadcast
components that you can get off the
shelf hooked up to a
laptop that was broadcasting that that
was delivering the content and was
located in a tenement addict in in uh
Brooklyn um and um and and we shut it
down because of the fact that it was
interfering with other stations licensed
stations one of the things about open
source is we don't want to create an
environment of pirate
AI
where
hey the code
to build an open- Source model is out
there and readily
available um we need to have standards
we need to have expectations we need to
have guard rails both in the application
of the technology and its
effects so we need to have uh guard
rails um Tom you also highlighted the
importance of a multi-stakeholder
process in developing industrial uh
industry standards how can we uh make
sure that those processes also address
the societal effects of a and not just
technical considerations well here's the
that's a great question San
and um and let me go back a little bit
uh this is one of the things I talk
about in in in
techlash when it came to regulate the
abuses of the industrial
era the Congress cloned the management
techniques of the companies that they
were going to
regulate and what were those management
techniques well they were there you had
you had a guy on the floor the shop
floor he was a guy at that point in time
over and following a rule book and he
was overseen by supervisors to make sure
that he was following the rule book and
they were overseen by managers and we're
surprised that we end up with a
rules-based bureaucracy that is
sclerotic and
micromanaging uh we shouldn't
be I contrasted that with
how digital management is done and
particular digital technical management
where standards are set by a
multi-stakeholder process that everybody
adheres to you know how did we get from
1 G to 2G to 3G to 4G to 5G and now 6G
for wireless phones it was a
multi-stakeholder process where uh where
everybody was participating
and where as witnessed by that Evolution
from 1G to 6G there was agility as
technology and the marketplace
changed how do we bring that kind of
agility into
government and so my concept is we do
the same thing that we did in the late
19th and early 20th century and that is
we clone the techniques the management
techniques that have brought us to this
point and apply them um in a new uh
governmental uh uh procedural
approach so clone uh their techniques uh
Tom Tom you have experience in both the
private sector and the government what
lessons do you think we can draw from
the regulation of other emerging
technologies that could you know inform
our approach to AI regulation
well you know I'm I'm I don't know if
this is emerging technology but you know
I'm struck right now by what we see in
the headlines every day about um Boe and
the standards for
aircraft okay I mean I mean I will I
will I will put a dollar on the table
right now Sanjay and say and bet you
that there aren't a half a dozen members
of Congress who can explain jet
propulsion or bui's principle which is
what keeps an airplane in the air yet we
have detailed expectations of how you
make that experience
safe and we oversee those expectations
and we have consequences for when they
aren't met
[Music]
we got to be able to do the same thing
for AI it seems to
me so something like an FAA or something
like that is that what you're saying
some people have suggested like we do
for nuclear weapons Etc uh it's
something like that is what you're
saying Tom what uh are some of the key
challenges and opportunities you see uh
to create a fair and Equitable
regulatory framework for AI
well I think first we've got to start
down the process we need to start having
the debate it is
terrific that Sam Alman and Brad Smith
and
others put an ante on the table if you
will right and said this is where the
discussion
begins now we need to get into the
details and as I said
before that isn't that doesn't mean that
you grab the
whole issue in one
armful but first you got to decide how
am I going to parse it into its
components that are bite-size and and
chewable if you will um and and then
start down the path of having the debate
about what
constitutes good policy for each of
those components and the frustration is
that we have had n plus1
hearings um you know God bless Joe Biden
and his executive order I mean I watch
the the
the difficulty pulling that together
across diverse federal
agencies and and and even
then it only had a couple of mandatory
requirements ments for llms in so far as
the application of the defense
production act and requiring red teams
and and transparency and Reporting and
things like this because that Authority
doesn't exist even in the presidency
even amidst all of the agencies of the
federal government and and when the
President issued the executive
order he said Congress needs to act
there isn't enough authority to deal
with these
issues we need to start the
discussion um and get specific about
okay how do we deal with the technical
issues how do we deal with the
behavioral effects issues and let's get
that debate going
on so let's get that debate going on Tom
uh you are with the FCC there was a big
issue about getting Broadband into Rural
and other areas you know we it's still
continuing on which boggles my mind
because I've been listening are there
concerns would you have that we could
have a AI divide where you
know whether it's rural or other parts
of uh our country you know you look at
even look at educational institutions I
see and we've had people from some of
the top universities and others come in
but we have community colleges 40% of
our students get uh uh their education
there we have uh rural Health Care
Systems which are going to be uh
engaging in AI you are dealing with this
whole access or FCC was maybe uh dealing
with the access to broadband and things
in some of these areas how do we make
sure there is an equity in AI to
so um let me tell you a story so I um we
ran a program that was a called
Universal service Fund in which we gave
out about four billion dollars a year to
subsidize broadband and unserved areas
which was entirely inefficient
ineffective and we proposed a change
which is that we need to pay for
broadband like we pay for roads which is
once which is actually what it was in
the infrastructure act and is now being
implemented by the by the Biden
Administration but one day I went to
Eastern
Kentucky to a town that had been
devastated by the coal industry
collapse and this excited my my my my
historical
leanings um because it was the railroad
that enabled the coal industry to exist
in the first place because the railroad
hauled the coal out of these hollers
they call them not a hollow a holler
that they call they call them down there
and um and and then all of a sudden the
coal industry died and you know what's
happening
now fiber optic is the new network and I
had the most incredible experience of of
being at a community college as you
suggest where there had now been
highspeed fiber connections to the
internet and I met some coal miners who
I'd shake their hand and they had these
huge hands that would just engulf my
hand I'd shake their hand and they're
learning to code and they were coding
for apple and they were coding for
Microsoft
because of the fact that they had access
to the market the same way that the the
the coal miners had access to the market
by the
railroad it is
essential that we connect all of America
but it's not you know I mean there's
probably 60 billion dollars total it's
now being spent to make sure that
America is connected with broadband
the purpose of that is not so that Aunt
Minnie sitting in her Farmhouse can
watch
Netflix that's a wonderful thing but the
real need is to make sure that the
warehouse down the street from Aunt mini
or the community college or the hospital
or the bank and in a world where
everything is done in the
cloud it is how to all those
institutions get access to the cloud on
an equal
basis and and AI becomes a component of
that and then one last observation as
you
know while I was chairman we passed the
net neutrality
rules that provided for open and
non-discriminatory access on reasonable
terms to the last mile of the internet
and the FCC is about the Trump FCC
killed those and the Biden FCC is about
to revisit them um next month and um and
one of the important things about an
open
internet is
AI because we can't have someone in
terms of the person the company that
controls the last mile of the network
work suddenly determine well here's how
AI is going to work or here's how it's
not going to work or here's what you're
going to get or here's what you're not
going to get and and um and and when you
stop and think about
it AI has been able to succeed
because the internet is a network of
networks in which packets can sort their
way around to make sure they get
delivered in the most efficient manner
until you get to the Last Mile and the
mile to your house and my house and we
need to make sure that that
openness that has allowed for the
establishment of large language models
and the access to those large language
models remains open safe and secure and
that's why an open internet and net
neutrality is important to AI we
discussed we have always it's been the
open internet has been going on has been
an argument going on for 20 years
literally 20 years and it moved
from video where Comcast was blocking
video because it was competitive to
their cable
service to when I dealt with the issue
it was about access
to websites and and and apps and now
it's about access to AI yeah and we need
a fast faren open in internet to do
that past fair and uh open internet Tom
those are uh great points for AI Equity
uh for all Tom uh final uh comments for
our audience I told you Global audience
uh who are listening to you uh it'll go
across uh what would be your final
comments to our uh audience well first
of all thank you very much Sanjay for uh
for the invitation and for this
interesting discussion
um I'm just anxious I know I I've got
ideas but I know that I don't have all
the answers but we need to have a
discussion about that and we need to
avoid retreating into our own corners
and lobing our talking points at each
other from across the the ring and get
out there and okay let's talk about how
we're going to accomplish those goals
let's understand that here's the
downside of this here's the upside of
this and let's be willing to make
compromises because nothing's perfect
you know I one of the things that I that
I learned when I was
chairman is that the public interest is
very much a fungible commodity and
everybody comes in would come into your
office and say oh I this you if you look
at what I want this way it's very much
in the the public interest and somebody
else would come in and say oh if you
look at it this way which happens to be
what I want it's in the public interest
we need to have the
tension between those kinds of forces
that will determine not who winners and
losers
are but how we protect the public
interest so talk to each other not
retreat in a corner and have that
discussion thank you Tom for sharing
your insights and expertise on this very
critical topic of AI regulation your
perspective as a former FCC chairman and
your deep understanding of the
telecommunication industry have shed a
real light on the complexities and
nuances in regulating this very rapidly
evolving field uh really really
appreciate this thank you for joining us
and I'm sure our listeners have gained
invaluable insights from this
conversation thank you so much Tom thank
you San thank you
