Traditional diplomacy
was built for slowness. Speed without
legitimacy is brittle.
Welcome to the Regulating AI podcast
with Sanjay Puri. AI is changing the
world faster than rules can keep up. So,
how do we protect people without killing
progress? Each week, Sanjay brings you
inside conversations with global
leaders, policy makers, and innovators
who are wrestling with that exact
question. So, if you're curious about
the future of technology and how it's
governed, you're in the right place.
Introducing Rui Pedro Darte, a global AI
trailblazer redefining how intelligence,
ethics, and diplomacy intersect. As
managing director and global AI
delegate, Rui bridges the gap between
innovation and responsibility.
>> Please join me in welcoming Ru Pedro
Dwarte to regulating AI.
>> Thank you, Sanjay. It's it's a real
pleasure to be here.
>> We want to just talk a little bit about
your background. It spans from serving
in parliament to communications for
academic publisher and now in this role.
How has this uh diverse experience
shaped your perspective on unique
governance challenges of AI?
>> For me the you know this whole journey
um and also this book uh that I just
wrote the statecraft 3.0 the age of AI
diplom really began with a a haunting
question um what happens when the art of
diplomacy is no longer human only right
and and that also reflects my journey in
my career. I've spent 16 years between
two very different worlds. One was
politics as you mentioned serving in
parliament shaping policy working inside
the slow machinery of state craft and
the other was the private sector in
which also uh I had the opportunity to
work for open science uh in an open
access uh company one of the biggest
open access publishers and uh by working
in in in science publishing uh I watched
how fast knowledge and technology are
accelerating
um with AI reshaping research itself and
that for me was a trigger to start
writing and and and and becoming an AI
thinker. I believe that AI sits exactly
you know right at the at the collision
points of these two tempos that I that I
have in my journey brought me to the
dilemma that I tried to reflect on my
book which is diplomacy is too slow
state machinery what I call state craft
2 2.0 O um and AI is too fast. So how
can we uh make diplomacy evolve?
>> How do you define or what do you mean by
AI diplomacy? Is it using AI for
diplomacy? What exactly is AI diplomacy?
>> Traditional diplomacy
was built for slowness. Think about the
the peace of West Falia or the Cold War
treaties or any other peace treaties.
They took years to negotiate, right?
Sometimes even decades. Um, think about
climate diplomacy, the most recent form
of diplomacy that has been bringing
together different stakeholders to the
table of negotiations from Kyoto to
Paris. It took a whole took whole
generations to to mature.
And that pace worked because politics
and technology advanced at roughly the
same tempo.
But AI breaks that rhythm and that's
where I make a point uh and the point of
AI diplomacy. It evolves exponentially.
So by the time diplomats and the old
state legacy institutions debate lethal
autonomous weapons or um any other
issue, drones like uh cargo 2 were
already deployed in Libya um operating
on their own uh uh on their own
judgment. So this is an example an
example I give in my book of the
mismatch between the political tempo of
the legacy institutions and what we used
to know as diplomacy and the
technological tempo um that we have
today. So this is already here and
that's the reason why uh Sanjay I use
the term quantum diplomacy. It's
diplomacy designed for the age of
acceleration, for the times that we live
in, the ones that are accelerating. And
it's about real-time adaptation. It's
about um like having treaties behaving
more like software uh instead of um
running at the glacial pace. Um self
updating as risks change. So it's about
expanding the negotiating table not just
to states uh but also to AI labs to open
source communities to corporations to
civil society and even decentralized
networks making sure that negotiation
happens at machine speed while still
grounded in human values. It's a big
challenge of course it's not easy in AI
time two years or a four years mandate
is a century. So the the the forces uh
that that that forces politicians to
break out of short termism and for the
first time I think leaders may be
compelled to think intergenerationally
and that's what I believe AI
paradoxically could save diplomacy from
its own inertia.
>> One of the big topics right now and I'm
going to uh discuss that also with you
uh later is AI agents agentic AI has
become a big big issue. Do you think AI
agents like for a country or a company
or any position could be negotiating
with other AI agents on key topics?
>> I think so. I think it's absolutely
possible. I think we'll see that in in
no time. Sanjay um and I think we should
be prepared and countries should be
prepared uh organizations should be
prepared for AI to AI protocols.
all the regulations, all the oversight
that we have on AI also comprehends and
and understands reflects that that
reality. We cannot afford to have one um
AI governance world again legacy
institutions um trying to run after AI
because this is not the same as internet
revolution. This is a new electricity
grid Sanjay and this will repower all
society as as we as we knew it h into a
new thing into a new world. So a new
social contract is expected with AI and
we need absolutely to make sense of of
what that means and and bring the the
stakeholders together, bring the main
actors together to um sooner rather than
later shape AI um and and make the most
of it. It doesn't have to be a negative
disruption. That's my point. It can and
should be and has all the potential to
be a positive disruption. It's it just
depends on us. Depends on what we do
now, what we do today, who we bring to
the table, how we involve global south,
how we involve open source communities,
coders, coders, for instance, those that
I imagine diplomats have never thought
about. Those are the the new best
partners for diplomats to be around the
table because coders will code faster
the new legislation than diplomats will
be able to negotiate. So they're in in a
way new diplomats as well. And this is
what AI diplomacy uh comprehends all the
new reality that AI is um is bringing up
to uh to the world.
So you're saying we need a new uh
basically AI to AI principle and a
framework. Yes.
>> Ry, you also have talked about creating
an AI diplomacy network for multilateral
cooperation. What would be its key
stakeholders uh and who would be having
a seat at this table in this network?
Washington has executive orders and the
US uh holds and has uh regional state
level uh protocols. Beijing has its
five-year plans and its own stated
driven approach. Companies like OpenAI
or Entropic, they're setting their own
constitutions, uh their own statements
of purpose. Uh none of these frameworks
um speak to each other yet. Um it's like
having multiple traffic systems with
different rules all on the same road. So
this ultimately makes collisions uh
inevitable. And that's why I argue for
an AI diplomacy network u a permanent
multilateral hub u imagine a Geneva uh
hub for AI governance where states,
companies, civil society, academia can
coordinate in real time. Again bringing
back um the real time idea which is a
core principle of AI diplomacy.
Diplomacy should evolve at um at real
time in real time speed uh or it will
dissolve and um and and the job of this
uh network would be to to connect the
dots. First by sharing incidents and
breakthroughs immediately not years
later. Uh second by setting ethical
baselines the way human rights treaties
did in the 20th century. Uh and third by
ensuring that global south is a
co-author not a bystander as we've been
uh as we've been seeing in in um in the
current forums. The way I see it is if
AI governance repeats the exclusions of
globalization then we'll again entrench
inequality for another century and all
the asymmetries that we see uh across
geographies. Um and so we need to uh put
hands on deck and ensure that we're
shaping and designing inclusively
um AI that can actually become the force
uh for um for for correcting those
asymmetries that we've created with
globalization and other global
phenomenons of development. when you
look at companies really like open AI
anthropic or do you look at them as
maybe even as countries who are now
charting their own constitutions they
are getting more as powerful as
countries in some ways
>> let me start by addressing the the
democratic aspect of AI which I think is
one of the most important ones um
authoritarian regimes yes they can move
quickly because they don't bother with
accountability democracies they need to
debate they need to consult they
deliberate and um of course they
sometimes appear slow but here's the
truth that policy makers need to hear um
speed without legitimacy is brittle so
authoritarian speed cracks also under
pressure and that's what democracies
need to focus on I believe which is to
coordinate and they can actually work if
they coordinate they can actually be
stronger if they coordinate And I think
that this coordination which is one of
the things that I argue in my book has
to have two fronts. Strategically
pulling resources for AI safety aligning
on shared standards. So this would
prevent regulatory arbitrage and other
phenomenons around the around the the
mis um coordination of of of standards
and AI. uh and uh narrative-wise
um countries need to prove to citizens
that AI doesn't mean choosing between
freedom and innovation which is often
the paradox that you hear from some
authoritarian leaders or movements. Um
and we can have both. If democracies
fail to coordinate, of course, they risk
being divided and outpaced and that
might might end up being a problem. But
if they succeed, they'll show the
ability to carry citizens along is the
real competitive advantage in the AI
age. So you also asked about the um the
the the way that I'm envisaging um this
network coordination and yes that's one
of the the one of the proposals I I make
uh on my book. One of the points is
exactly to come up with a UN type um
organization platform to ensure that
policy makers, diplomats, open source
communities, formal nonformal actors,
all the voices around the table can
really play an active role in shaping um
the next the next decade. You know,
historically we've had democracy,
authoritarianism, we've got communism,
we have socialism, all kinds of, you
know, dictatorships, etc. Do you think
because of AI, maybe there needs to be a
new paradigm shift?
>> That's a great question. I I don't know
uh I don't know the answer uh entirely.
What I can say Sanja is that old
ideologies will matter less
and what we should focus on and how we
treat AI.
We should treat AI as a critical public
infrastructure rather than
u private uh projects. And what would
this transformation required for both
policy makers and and the private
sector? And right now AI is the in the
hands of a few you know powerful
corporations that are ahead way ahead of
the of the of the state craft of the uh
legacy institutions. Um and that's of
course not sustainable. Um if think
about it if the internet had been born
as a monopoly we wouldn't have seen the
explosion of creativity inclusion and
global connectivity that followed. So we
need to make a shift and yes we need to
treat AI as a critical infrastructure
and that might mean u to your point
public investment uh in foundational
models uh the way we invest in in in
highways or electricity grids should
also apply to AI. So to some degree um
there needs to be a new in the new
social contract that is being shaped as
we speak by AI. Um somehow the uh
government the public uh uh the public
sector needs to play a critical role.
That's the only thing I can say or at
least the only thing I envisage and and
the point I make in my book. Um it means
open standards. So no single player can
be able to lock in the system. Um and it
means also shared governance. Uh moving
away from author authoritarian or um uh
isolationist policies. It means because
infrastructure cannot depend on
corporate goodwill alone. It needs to be
shared with the with the other with the
other uh stakeholders at the table. that
again as I said before that need to be
representative of the voices we we need
to to have reflected on the on the
future of AI. Reed, there has been a lot
of conversation that you know the
economic gains of productivity or from
AI will enable maybe universal basic uh
income which is UBI means everybody gets
you know and that's something that you
touch on and you talked about very
eloquently in your book also you also
have talk about that AI could either
entrench digital divides or become a
force for global equity.
We need collaborative velocity. Um and
collaborative velocity is the philosophy
I believe should be entrenched in the
new systems in the new thinking
governing the global institutions. So
instead of having a a a a reigning
competing uh mindset, we need to have
collaborative velocity. We need to have
that collaborative velocity in the u new
paradigm of AI diplomacy.
uh in the new paradigm of state craft
but also uh in the way that um voices
from the north and the south uh need to
be represented and need to be at the
table of decisions. So I do think that
we need to move towards an integrated
governance paradigm that um includes
everyone and that can really correct the
um the the silonomics which is a term
that I use um and I wrote about it um
and I use this to to describe what
happens when we treat every crisis in
isolation.
So with AI, you see it everywhere.
Defense ministries are looking at
autonomous weapons. Health ministers are
debating AI diagnostics. Education
ministers are panicking about GPT in
classrooms. Each ministry or each
statecraft area or department builds its
own little silo. With AI, that changes.
Uh and AI isn't a sector. It's a it's
it's a systemic force like electricity.
So you don't regulate electricity
differently for hospitals or schools or
banks. You create a universal framework
but that need to cut across ministries
ac across governance areas. It means
international protocols for AI incidents
uh so that when something goes wrong
we're not scrambling around with
fragmented responses. And it means also
treating AI as infrastructure, not just
a product. That's the big shift I
believe. And for policy makers and
diplomats, um here's the message. If you
regulate AI, peace meal, you'll always
be behind. Integration is not a luxury.
Is the only way to match AI scope and
speed. And that for me, Sanjay, is the
is the is the real deal. We have some
and you touched upon past uh challenges
and how international cooperation worked
towards some of them whether it was clim
you know climate change pandemic or some
of these other ones.
Are there in your view uh one or two key
lessons that we can derive from them in
terms of putting this kind of a
framework together for AI?
>> Absolutely. And one one of the biggest
lessons I've just learned when I was
serving the open science sector um and
it it's very recent for all of us um
it's from the COVID crisis period um
what we've seen was an amazing
collaborative velocity that was actually
the example that inspired my concept in
the book because I've just realized um
when serving open science and open
access science an open access publisher
that we've had we were so fast in coming
up with vaccines and a solution to um
solve the the the the biggest crisis of
my life at least and and and the recent
decades because we had scientists,
pharmaceutical companies and governments
collaborating an unprecedented speed and
that's that's exactly what happened. So
we had an international mandate where um
all the science was published in open
access. So we had an open access mandate
for all the science and because everyone
had access to the same science to every
piece of science being produced produced
in every corner of the world that
accelerated the solution. So my question
is Sanjay why don't we do the exactly
same thing for climate. Think about
this. Almost 50% of climate science is
still today behind pay walls. What does
that mean? Does that means that the
science being produced in the global
thou or in the north
cannot be accessed by either students.
So we need to bridge that gap
immediately and that's exactly where
companies have a big responsibility.
That's exactly my point when I say that
this is not just another product. And
there there there's the need to to to to
to a mindset shift. They're not just
building products anymore.
They're becoming stewards for public
trust. So for policy makers is it also
means to step up to learn from the past
to learn with that COVID period not
waiting on Silicon Valley or Shenzhen
but shaping AI as a public good
immediately and that requires and
demands some initiative the mind
requires
some proactiveness requires everyone
around the table to have a voice and
requires also some openness.
to bring in the voices that have been
left out for too long.
>> Yeah. So
openness. The only thing is really
during the pandemic there the fear
brought everybody together. The fear of
death, the fear of mass uh deaths, uh
destructions of economies and everything
else.
How do you kind of say AI and AI has
also become a geopolitical issue because
I I want it because it'll help me for
let's say a country for their economy
their defense their national security
versus somebody else's. So how how do
you kind of sell that message to other
countries? Whatever we we build
together, it needs to be grounded and
well grounded on a trustworthy
uh framework, a trustworthy
um vision and a um collective
understanding on on what are the the
collective challenges and the collective
forces that we have at our disposal
because the planet doesn't hold much
longer um with uh this um you know this
social divides
with uh different approaches and uh
regionalisms.
Uh I think we need to um and my message
to the world leaders that have their
hands on and that have the pen to change
um at least legislation is that we need
uh AI is already here and is already
everywhere. So, uh either we like it or
not um things will change. A new social
contract will be will be will be in
place uh sooner rather than later. And
um I think we better uh get everyone on
board as soon as possible to ensure that
uh we did um to ensure that we have that
we're successful as we did with the with
the pandemic. Um it's true what you said
Sanjay the fear brought us together but
it was also unprecedented the
cooperation that you had among
international institutions and
governments see in AI the opportunity to
correct old asymmetries I think that's
um enough to uh form a base of
understanding among the the ones that
will have the the that will have voice
around the table of decisions. So my
message is quite clear. I think we need
to build trust. We need to build trust
among the the players that uh that that
that have the responsibility to shape AI
and we have to have uh the um the
conscience that uh AI will do it for us
if we don't do it ourselves. Do you
think the world now needs a new
generation of political leaders who are
AI native, a younger generation of
people like you uh Ruie who are AI
native uh and understand the potential
of this.
>> I think we need to rapidly transition to
a new generation of policy makers.
Sanjay
>> and I know it's not easy to
>> to change things um when you have um so
many forces competing um in what is
usually a zero sum game but uh we this
one is is really pivotal. Um, we need a
new path. Um, we need a new vision. Uh,
an AI native uh, generation of of policy
makers, one that understands exactly the
risks um, and the opportunities that AI
brings and um, one that is ready to
embrace this as a positive disruption.
As I said, because I I look and I speak
to many young people uh, in my job. I
work in a technology company. So, uh
many of the software developers I deal
with and all the technologists and
people that are on the business, they do
have a positive idea about about AI.
They don't see it as a as a risk uh in
the first place. Of course, it has its
risks and everyone is more and more
aware, but they see it as an opportunity
to change things for for better, change
things for good. So
understanding that that that feeling,
understanding that that's becoming
common sense among the new generations
um should really be reflected in the in
the political leaderships of today. So
um we'll see if you know AI contributes
to um to close that gap uh between uh
how
oldest generation older generations see
AI and u and and new generations
understand AI. But ultimately I agree I
think we need to I think we need to to
transition to a new generation and I
think AI will also put some pressure on
that front to be honest. The point is
Sanjay the world is transitioning
already. Um are the policy makers
already ready to transition? That's the
question for those that um that that are
in power right now.
>> Yeah. So we are in a transition and Ru
says uh that a new generation an AI
native generation is definitely needed.
Ru thank you so much. uh this
conversation really illuminates for our
audience a critical insight that you
provided effective AI governance
requires the same kind of systemic
thinking that you're advocating for in
moving beyond silonomics your unique
perspective that bridges you know
political economic theory with practical
policy experience really offers our
listeners a framework for understanding
AI governance which is not a technical
problem to be solved but as a complex
diplomatic challenge requiring a new
international cooperation as Ruie has
laid out.
>> Thank you so much for having me Sanjay.
Looking forward to to to a new one.
Thank you.
