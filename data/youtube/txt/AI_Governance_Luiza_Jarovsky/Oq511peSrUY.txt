welcome everyone to the AI governance
live Talk number 23 today I'm here with
ano Bradford welcome ano it's such a
pleasure to have you thank you so much
for having me I'm delighted to be here
my my pleasure my honor Professor Anna
Bradford she is a professor of Law and
international organizations at Columbia
University and she's a leading scholar
on global economy and digital
regulations so for those who don't know
she coined this term Brussels effect so
she has a book with the same name and
she has this the most recent book is
this one maybe digital Empires the
global battle to regulate technology and
it's crazy how she anticipated so much
that is going WR right now so it's I'm
so happy to have an here today to
discuss those uh super timely uh topics
uh so today our the topic of our
discussion is the global AI race
regulation and power and I think there's
so much I was talking now with ano there
is so much going on so we can even
deviate a little bit that politics and
other topics if now talking about the
book so before we we speak about our uh
the main topics of our discussion I'd
love to hear from you Anna so how what
how did you have the idea to write this
book so why talking about the three
digital Empires so where did it all
start yeah so Louisa first of all thanks
again so much for having me I really
admire the work that you do and the fact
that we can have such a global
conversation on the topics that really
matter and touch all of us so so how did
the book come about I it builds on the
my earlier work on the Brussels effect
so I've been really interested in
Europe's place in the world and and
trying to counter this narrative that
the Europeans are a waning power they
don't uh matter anymore the world is
about us and China and the Brussels
effect was an attempt to elevate then
regulation as a form of power how
regulation shapes the products we
produce and consume and and then that
increasingly is now conversation that
has moved to the digital space so I
talked in the Brussels
about the eu's ability to shape Global
privacy uh regulations so how the gdpr
has had a global impact and the
conversations about the Brussels effect
then got me deeper into what is the eu's
role in shaping the digital world so it
was about the gdpr we started talk about
hate spee
disinformation and as the eu's
regulatory activities grew so we had the
digital markets act and Digital Services
act and AI act it seemed to be that
that's where the gravity of the
conversation was so I really wanted to
see whether and how the EU can sort of
promote its values and defend its
interests in a digital world that is so
dominated by American Tech Giants and so
I started working on the digital Empires
with the goal of laying out the kind of
geopolitics of digital governance and
the differences that we uh observe when
we compare how the United States views
the digital world what are its goals
what kind of digital future it wants to
build and then contrasting that to the
EU and I also wanted to add China
because I felt it was so interesting to
then contrast and in the book I talk
about how the the Americans had this
Market driven way of thinking about
digital governance the Chinese the state
driven and the Europeans rights driven
so I thought it was a a good way to
offer different analytical framework um
for the three to better understand um
sort of the the Contours of of their
digital governance but also the rest of
the world to try to situate themselves
uh uh with the view of those three
models that I think are predominant ways
of thinking about governing digital
Technologies uh and and as as we spoke
before so you a lot of what we are
seeing in the last two weeks we can
absolutely I was thinking about your
book so when we read for example uh the
last two weeks we saw one by almost all
EU data protection authorities started
to investigate deepik which is a Chinese
company right so I saw wow here we have
the two what of the two of the three
Empires we are talking about them so
using data Protection Law as a tool so
is it a political tool are they invest
so are they applying the same level of
scrutiny when we have open Ai and DP 6
so are are the EU data protection
authorities looking closely to all the
Privacy policies as they are doing with
d 6 privacy policy I was I was thinking
about that so about your book about the
empires but we'll talk about that in a
second uh I don't know if you know so
you know in previous uh I think at the
least in the last five talks I always
asked the the guests if they think the
Brussels effect is going to happen in AI
so as just because you mentioned so I'm
going I was going to ask that after but
I there is no better person than you to
the official the creator of the term uh
the Brussels effect so I'm going to
anticipate that question so we saw in in
the field of data protection we indeed
saw the Brussels effect happening right
they for those in the audience that
don't know Al the G gdpr the E General
data protection regulation uh in Europe
became globally uh influential so many
countries so I'm Brazilian I know
Brazil's data Protection Law is heavily
inspired by the gdpr and other uh
countries in the world are also inspired
so and the BRS effect also for those who
don't know is this uh influence so the
regulatory influence that the EU has
over the world and and as en says so is
a way to also exercise power through
regulations so it's one one of the ways
you can influence and also exercise
power so I wanted to ask you do you
think that we we are going to see uh the
Brussel effect in AI regulation is it
simil can we compare with it with data
protection or is different and it's not
going to happen the same way what are
your thoughts on that so it's a great
question so first I would I distinguish
between two types of Brussels effect so
I talk about de facto and dour de facto
Brussels refers to the companies
incentives to apply the EU regul ation
more broadly so the idea that they are
adjusting their products or services or
their conduct to EU regulations not just
with respect to the operations in the EU
but across the world the same idea that
you see that when uh apple or Microsoft
or Google or meta are using the gdpr as
their Global privacy policy so that's
the de facto uh aspect of it then
there's the dour Brussels effect which
refers to different countries emulating
the EU in their own legisl
so we see countries adopt variations of
the gdpr as state domestic privacy
regulations so I think we can we can ask
the question whether we see either
companies uh adjusting uh towards those
EU ax obligations also outside of the EU
and the second question whether we see
other countries emulate so I think that
the first one is still something that we
don't quite know the extent to which it
will happen because all of the AI acts
Provisions they are not yet in force so
compan are in the process of devising
their different compliance strategies
but there's certainly logic that it
makes sense that if you adjust your you
are a company that is that has different
headquarters maybe somewhere outside of
the EU but you have uh extensive
activities in the EU you want to make
sure that you're hiring algorithms so
your global bank your algorithms in
terms of that you use your AI driven
system that you use to um U measure
individual's credit worthiness that they
are unbiased because they would be
highrisk applications why would you then
once you adjust your AI systems to be
consistent with the a the eu's AI act
why would you then tolerate less uh uh
um sort of well performing AI systems in
other parts of the world so you probably
not going to have them bias uh hiring
algoritms in some parts of the world and
only comply with respect of the EU so
there may be scale economies and other
where you want to streamline and have a
uniform product across the company and
since you will uh obey the EU say I act
in the EU you do it in the rest of the
world so logic is certainly there the
idea too that if you want to use data uh
that involves European data to train
your AI systems you don't necessarily
want to retrain them uh the the same uh
uh the AI applications in different
jurisdictions with different data so you
want to make sure that you have obtained
your data for training consistent with
the gdpr consistent with the various uh
copyright uh provisions and so forth so
there may be a way that it globalizes
the the the the the way the companies
offer the AI driven products and
services then we also see already some
indications including I would use South
Korea as an example of countries
emulating the EU because almost all
governments are now having a
conversation how do we govern Ai and
even though the Americans seem to be
going to the kind of very doubling down
on the techn libertarian instincts and
really sort of entrenching the idea that
governance is an afterthought like speed
and AI development is what they are
going for at first um most governments I
think con that they need to somehow
regulate AI so there is a template out
there and the template of the eu's AI
act it is the first in the world that is
binding that is comprehensive horizontal
regulation so so many governments are
likely to use that as a starting point
they may deviate from the eu's AI act in
some respects but they probably adopt
for instance the risk-based approach and
even some categories that the EU has
adopted so I certainly would not I
wouldn't expect that there's going to be
a wholesale Brussels effect the entire
world is going to be converted uh to the
the kinds of AI governance that the EU
had Invision for itself but I expect
there to be certainly at least partial
br effect even though some of that may
come with some years down the
road and and two comments on that so I'm
glad you you mentioned South Korea so
was one of the the Deep Dives I I wrote
in the newsletter about so of course was
a fact the other one that I recently
analyzed so it's not yet enacted but it
there is a draft is the Brazilian AI law
so uh so it's funny I was reading some
of the the provisions they are copy and
paste from the AI act and as you
mentioned the template so I can imagine
lawmakers are busy they say wow the
Europeans they spent years discussing
that so why not copy and paste and it
will look so nice in our country as well
probably so in a way yes it's a template
and and I can I can see that especially
yeah so that's not the only topic
lawmakers are deciding so if you don't
not have a lot of time why do not take
whatever is ready and it has this
Geographic it's it's uh extra
territorial uh scope right it's beyond
the EU so companies from any country
offering their AI systems in the you
they are going to have to comply so why
not follow the Leist
you mentioned Brazil so I want to say
there's also this kind of advantage that
the EU has that everything including AI
act but also all the decisions around
them existing multiple languages
including in Portuguese including in
French uh including in Spanish which
often also enhances the uh the
temptation to use the EU as a model
because you have them available in
multiple languages and but also then
there is this idea that the EU
regulations are often seen as a gold
standard
that they are the ones that are well
thought through and I must say that if
you look at the substance of the AI act
it's actually a very balance regulation
and I think that's what many governments
will find it is protective it does
protect the rights um the digital rights
uh of individuals but it's also I would
say very pro-innovation it's something
that many would say that look this is
what every responsible company would
want to do anyway so in many ways I
think the EU is successful partially
because it manages to Foster compromises
among member states all of which don't
exactly agree so the the legislative
Products that come out of the EU are
already compromises which means they are
more likely to be transplantable in
other jurisdictions they are not as
extreme but in instead they are well
thought through expert driven pieces of
legislations that are respected and then
there was the more practical side note
that I mentioned it helps that they are
available also in in different languages
and and you mentioned this this fact
that this balance so this is something I
teaching the AI governance training so
it is and so it I think it's balanced
and also there are many loopholes and
exception so when I'm so I've read
multiple times so I know there are
unfortunately I think the the final text
is probably it's it's D diluted and it's
probably much lighter than what they
initially wanted so we know when we for
all those who follow the news you know
that the last months of the legislative
process were were marked by heavy
lobbying by by especially friend friends
and maon personally and mistal and
startup so we we read all about that and
so for sometimes we see so we'll go back
to that topic in a different context but
we see in the in the public discourse so
some narratives of overregulation so
every time I see especially someone from
the tax sector saying that the EU act
it's
overregulation commenting on the it's
actually so narrow it's so so so is for
for those not wear so prohibited AI
practices are is the there the the
strictest category so this is where the
EU was tough they prohibited but when
you read they end up with a very very
narrow provision so sometimes as a
lawyer I say well I'm not sure if any
company will ever be uh fine because of
this just because they end it's it ends
up very narrow and as and was mentioned
so balanced uh so every time for those
in the audience you hear people
complaining about it's over regulated so
tell them please tell me which provision
exactly are you talking I can answer
each tell me one that I will answer why
it's probably not as strict as as you
imagin just because and this I was
commenting on that so last week also I
think people from the technical side
they underestimate legal knowledge so
they think it's just Google it right
they think it's only uh whatever it's
just to look at the text the letter of
the law and you have all the answers so
there's much more there's the legal
system and so on and and just to comment
on the broad of of fact so I I I love
your your breakdowns so the factor the U
and I I I was when I just a comment
about dipstick and and I wanted to ask
your opinion if you think that is really
happening so in the last two weeks we
saw the as I was commenting so the data
protection authorities investigating
deep seek and from my perspective what
happened is so when you see one by one
so and there is the media so for was the
the Irish the Italian the Portuguese the
Spanish so and they in the media covers
it so we hear that each one of them is
investigating then we started hearing
authorities from other countries so we
heard Japan South Korea don't you think
that there is this maybe a third level
Brussels effect which is kind of
enforcement level Brussels effect so
imagine your country you're and there
Advocates they they nonprofits paying
attention to they're going to pressure
their governments are you not going to
investigate so do you see that as well
so it could be a third level play and I
count that as part of the dour Brussels
effect so it can be the legislators that
are emulating the templates coming from
Europe but it can also be enforcement
authorities and we saw this a lot in the
competition law the Anti-Trust spacee
where the eu's cases against Google you
saw similar reasoning similar theories
of harm that other antitrust agencies in
other countries we're relying on so in
many ways the the European enforcement
actions already give a cue first of all
they elevate these cases to the
consciousness of regulators elsewhere
who say okay the EU is looking at this
there seems to be a problem let us look
at if it's a problem in our Market as
well then they can also some people use
the word and I use it negatively free
right on the evidence and the kind of
Investigations and the the way the
Europeans build the case and and that
can help also agencies that don't quite
have the resources of some of the
European agencies so they learn from
those investigations and then they are
able to um build their own cases
sometimes also the prospect of
enforcement in other jurisdictions leads
to the de facto Brussels effect when
these companies are anticipating uh
cases following then in the other
markets as well so they say well the EU
is after us we need to comply we may as
well extend this to uh other markets as
well Australian Regulators have
sometimes done that okay let's see how
Google implements the remedy that was
imposed by the Europeans if they also
apply to Australian activities we are
good we don't need to do anything but if
they don't we're gonna bring our own
case so I think that's an absolutely
right one that you identifi that we see
this happen at many level it can be the
legislators but it can also be the
enforcers
super so I'm I'm glad I got you the
under Brad for stamp Theory I want to go
back to your book by the way those who
haven't read oh sorry it's blurred
digital Empires you should uh read it
absolutely must read to understand
what's going on so digital Empires is
not only about AIS but I want to
understand your in the AI context so in
digital Empires you bring the three
digital Empire so China EU and us and I
I would say especially for those in the
audience that haven't read the book at
so we we have an AI race going on and
it's getting it looks it feels like at
least maybe because I'm obsessed I'm
reading all the news that I'm posting so
maybe it's just my bubble but maybe
other people in the audience can
disagree but it feels like it's
accelerating there's a lot of pressure
right so every time you see new so 500
billions in the US and then mron says
109 billion for France and then each one
wants to bet higher and and we see the
losses and so on so it feels like it's
accelerating then we have ship bands and
other legal measures so from a a
perspective of the AI race when we think
about China us and EU so different ways
of uh exercising power and and also
regulating AI which one would you say is
is the is is the best way or how how can
we think about those three different
ways in the context of the AI race so is
it is there a better way so is it looks
it feels like perhaps the the the the
better way for an AI race is the
American way d Market driven so you're
going to just be the ones leading the
the AI so build the chips and then build
the models and build build the systems
you're probably going to win this race
but maybe there there is another way of
of seeing that so when when we look at
the Chinese way so they have uh for
example censorship law we'll talk more
about that later on I wanted to hear
from you how do you see uh the the
digital empires in the context of the AI
race which way is better to to win this
race is there a better way yes so I
think we need to First Define what are
are we trying to accomplish so if you by
winning mean that you're going to build
the most powerful model even while
exposing your individuals and societies
to existential risks I wouldn't call
that a win but but ultimately that's
what sometimes when when you start
approaching like an arms race that you
think about AI as a powerful tool for
not just economic power but for
geopolitical and military power and if
then comes with this idea that the more
powerful tools you have the more you are
sort of likely to be winning the race
and I think it's a very dangerous way of
approaching AI but I I regret that we
seem to be now living through the kind
of paradigm shift that we are not just
trying to balance the opportunities but
risk but we are too optimistic about the
opportunities if you look at the Spirit
of the AI Summit in Paris you saw the
US's and the UK's unwillingness to sign
the Declaration as uh in they slowing
down the progress that is available and
possible in this space so that to me
reflects the sentiment that that that we
are now experiencing that the the race
is
accelerating uh the geopolitics are
getting I think harder and harder to
navigate which then increases the
tensions between the two leading
superpowers in the AI race China and the
US and and that makes both of them then
more reluctant to slow down their own
capability is because there's really
this idea of relative gains if we slow
down they will not and so it really
takes this unfortunate Dynamic whereby
we we are no longer looking at this from
the point of view of Rights and
responsibilities and ethics and I am not
Louisa let's just be very clear I am
very excited about the benefits uh
embedded in AI Technologies I am not
anti- AI I really just think we need to
be very mindful that we engage in this
striving for realizing these benefits in
a way that is responsible and at the
same time that we are mindful of having
the governance framework so that
governance is at the heart and center of
how we develop Ai and not an
afterthought but here if you think about
the three Empires so I I talk about the
Americans um embracing this Market
driven model so it's really embedded in
an American DNA that believes in markets
that is very skeptical of government
intervention that thinks about you know
more kind of the terms of like a techn
Liber Arian techno Optimist way of of
viewing the world and really thinks that
Innovation is at the heart of the
American Empire including the digital
Empire and you see that the Americans do
that now in Ai and we really see a
U-turn because under President Biden's
uh um Administration we see the
Americans balance their Market driven
instincts with the closer to kind of
European rights driven instincts we saw
the executive order on AI we saw much
more conscious of engaging in
international cooperation around AI
safety and willingness to work with
other techn democracies to to slow down
the anti-democratic uses deploying AI
for Mass surveillance and so forth but
the US seems to be now retreating back
to really like doubling down on its
Market driven instincts so the question
is what do then the the Americans and
the Chinese do so China is very Focus I
talked about Chinese um governing
through this state driven model um which
really has the goal of making China a
technological superpower but also then
deploying Technologies like AI as a tool
for surveillance and control and
government propaganda so one big
question for Chinese is that AI for the
government is a doublet swort it can
endanger the censorship regime if you
have the the uh deep seeks of the world
basically undermine the political
message of the Communist party and then
threaten social stability within the
nation so the Chinese need to govern AI
to make sure that it does not then um
sort of work against the political
system but then AI is also a very
powerful tool including for government
surveillance and that's there's
tremendous supply and demand for those
technologies that can be used in a way
that enhances the government's ability
to control its citizens so in that sense
we seeing this from China and
interesting thing when you mention deep
seek though is that that's a message to
the Chinese government that the state
driven model just State investing more
money doesn't guarantee progress deep
seek didn't benefit from State money
deep seek benefited from private
investment so I think that's a very very
interesting observation then if I
mention sort of how the Europeans
position themselves in this race so in
the digital Empires I describe the
Europeans as as believing that they
cannot choose the American or the
Chinese model the market driven model
for the the Europeans is simply too
permissive whereas the Chinese State
driven model is too oppressive so the
Europeans have carved out their own
Third Way Forward so this idea of a more
fair Digital Society where the
protection of fundamental rights of
individuals the Democratic structures of
the society those really take the stent
to state so it's a view that leades with
this idea of human Centric technological
development and I think that's why we
have regulations like AI act emanate
from the EU because the EU believes that
the governments can step in for the
benefit of protecting individuals and
societies and steering the AI future
towards the kinds of values that
Europeans hold here but Louisa I I do
detect some hesitation now among the
Europeans they're losing to some extent
their own confidence in their own model
which is why I'm saying that the biggest
threat to the Brussels effects is now
the Europeans themselves so if there is
this sense then I think for good reason
Europeans are worried about they Tech
competitiveness they don't see the
European uh Tech firms including AI
developers uh uh dominate the same way
Americans do and the way Chinese do so
there is this soul searching now why
that is and there's a very unfortunate
but very prevalent narrative that
because of Europe's commitment to
digital regulation the Europeans are
only regulating but not generating these
Technologies so the way forward would be
to abandon those commitments to digital
regulation and then emulate the
Americans and this kind of Market driven
model and less constraining regulatory
environment and that would allow AI
development to flourish and I really
have been cautioning against this
narrative I really think it is a false
choice and this is I've written a paper
called false choice between digital
regulation and Innovation where I argue
that the European's commitment to
regulations like the gdpr or the AI act
that's not Europe's problem that's not
what is holding the Europeans back why
we see the Americans be more successful
is that they have a integrated digital
single Market we don't in Europe so
Europe is balkanized by 27 different
member states with different laws with
different languages with different
cultures it is harder for tech companies
to scale in Europe there's no deep
integrated Capital markets in Europe you
cannot raise money for your Innovations
the same way that the American companies
do
Europeans have punitive bankruptcy laws
that deter risk-taking and you cannot
really do disruptive AI development if
you are done for good if your company
goes bankrupt that's not the case in the
US and another other uh difference I
would highlight Americans have been
enormously successful in recruiting the
Global Talent to come and benefit the US
AI development and that's not the case
in Europe so if we look for a b for
European Tech competitiveness and we
want to make the EU not just a regulat
but AI develop the AI superpower let's
not try to repeal the regulatory
commitments let's at the same time
integrate that single Market really
build that Rob robust Capital markets
try to find out the way for the
Europeans to attract the Global Talent
and create the legal Frameworks and the
cultural uh Frameworks that encourage
and not discourage risk-taking so that's
a I think my my long way of saying that
I think we need to understand what the
problem is in order to have a correct
solution I love that you brought the
topic so about Innovation and regulation
so two comments on what you said so I
think so it I think it's a fact that the
EU is lagging behind so I I don't think
so we have data we have the the infamous
now dragy report right about EU
competitiveness so was something that it
looks like was a a game changer in the
EU uh but but I I I I agree with you so
it's it might be lagging beh but not why
do you immediately assume why people
immediately assume that it's because of
Regulation so there are you mentioned
the cultural aspects or re can even be
some something of a deeply inherited
cultural aspect of risk taking which is
a part of American society or access to
investment you mention Bank bankruptcy
laws and other uh other things that
might be influencing so this is uh one
thing and you mentioned at the beginning
and I think it's super interesting that
the EU is kind of losing confidence in
itself and I I want I think it's super
uh timely we are just saw that the the
AI Summit just ended right in Paris so
for those in the audience if you're
reading the news in this this week there
was this big event AI Summit in Paris
and what I saw there and some of the the
speeches and the comments it it fell to
me and this is for those in the audience
this will be the topic of today's
newsletter it looks like the EU is CH is
uh Switching gears they you changed its
mind so I want to hear ano's opinion on
that so some of the quotes So I saw for
macron we already know right since the a
act draft the mcon is saying that no we
we must support uh French entrepreneurs
or european entrepreneurs so let's the a
Act is too strict so we already knew
macron so he he said some various
declarations from macron like he
announced the investment he said we are
going to simplify the rules so unclear
as a lawyer unclear to me what he means
in practice and then there is Hanah V
vun she she is the EU digital chiefy
it's not the official title but that's
how they call her so she said that
they're the EU is going to implement the
laws so they're referring to probably
the DSA gdpr and a act in a business
friendly way whatever that means in
practice when the law is supposed to
protect fundamental rights and reduce
risk so Implement that in a business
friendly way I don't know exactly what
it means and then you saw we saw also
Ursula Von fion I don't know if I
pronounced right so she's the president
of the commission so various speeches
she said she only spoke about Innovation
investment competition the you is here
we are we are back to the race we did so
it felt really a different tone I I felt
a different EU and I just posted now a
video of when JD Vin so the US vice
president was speaking and he was tough
you know kind of aligned with Trump's
messaging and he he he looked at the
audience and at the EU and we want we
are not going to be to have to be
constricted by EU laws and especially
you Europeans and the camera film what
Von's face okay it's the kind of a power
messaging and it felt like the EU is
going down and kind of okay this bu
business friendly thing to me was okay
so what that means from a legal
perspective and I don't know and and
then something also for the audience
that was last year there was this report
on EU competitiveness I think it was uh
his name is one of the EU lawmakers
sponsored this report I think is a
draggy his name and it was also was
widely shared and kind of raised the
attention of EU lawmakers that the you
must change so I'm feeling this Vibe
shift and now that the I saw some I I
listened to some of the speeches in the
AI Summit I I think it feels like the EU
decided to change and to to finish that
to conclude this this this idea what we
saw yesterday and I also wrote about
that yesterday so the EU decided to
withdraw the AI liability directive and
for those also it's also the topic of
today's newsletter so stay tuned for in
a few hours I'm going to publish it but
basically what it what it mean so let's
remember that the AI the EU has the AI
act it was so entered into Force August
1 last year it's slowly becoming
enforcable first batch of Provisions
became enforcable uh February 2nd it's
happening okay but the AI act does not
cover liability what that means so if
something goes wrong and people are
going to be harmed so if there is harm
there are no specific rules on how to
compensate victims so how do you assess
who is guilty not guilty defective
product AI so those all those liability
rules they are not specified in the AI
act so we have the product uh liability
directive which was recently amended
last year but it it's it covers specific
types of harm not for example
discrimination and other types of AI
related harm so we really need AI
liability and at this point so because
the Big Hope was the AI liability Direct
dirve which was yesterday withdrawn by
the EU and now the the consequence is
that we have now 27 liability regimes so
as Anna was mentioning so this complex
puzzle so when whoever wants to offer AI
systems in the EU so first they're going
to comply with existing Union law and
national laws also AI act and they are
going to have in mind 27 different
potential liability regimes so it it's
bad it's something not good it doesn't
look good it feels like okay so the you
is not really into this whole single
market and it for me it really fit into
this feeling or or this impression that
I'm having that the EU is changing so
especially regarding your book digital
Empire do you think that the EU is so
they kind of okay until 2024 it it was
nice to be the regulatory power now the
the the political pressure is too much
and pressure from all sides and Market
pressure and all sorts of pressures now
we want to change do do do you feel that
or am I mistaken is there something
beyond that I'm not seeing well so what
are your thoughts on these so I
completely agree and in many ways I
wholeheartedly agree that the EU must
radically change the question is in
which way to which direction so I think
we need to now make sure that that we
understand what are the eu's real
weaknesses and try to mitigate those
weaknesses the EU lives today in a
really dangerous unstable GE
geopolitical
world where we have Russia's invasion of
Ukraine the EU needs to dedicate much
more funds and resources into building
its defenses building its armies it is a
an absolute sad reality that we are back
in the era where we need to focus on the
fundamental safety of the Europeans from
a military attack of an enemy we also
have entered the era where the the EU
was constructed to operate in the world
of multilateral corporation
international institutions its ability
to work closely with traditional allies
like the United States today the EU is
increasingly vulnerable because it
cannot trust the United States as a
partner and as an ally so it it rightly
is more worried about its strategic
Independence uh its autonomy and its
ability to defend its interest and
values in today's world so I think it is
a right conversation to be having my
main concern is that we would need to
think what will actually then help the
EU gain that autonomy and that
Independence and I think we are tackling
the kind of the wrong problems we are
now starting to
dismantle the the regime around digital
rights and the governance of these
Technologies because I think they have a
deeply rooted support among European
people across the political parties
across the member states and I don't
think we are forced to make the choice
this is not privacy versus growth I
think in many ways there is uh there's a
way to grow the European economies and
Shore up its digital capabilities
without sacrificing the European rights
and European values and that's why I
think this combination of internal
pressures from within Europe to now
start seeing regulation as an enemy to
economic growth and Innovation and
external pressures that's increasing
alliance between Silicon Valley and
Washington DC where the tech companies
are now trying to co-op the US
Administration and say you help us push
back on European regulations and we see
individuals like vice president JD Dan
say that look maybe we will not give Aid
to Ukraine anymore unless you drop
investigations in our tech companies the
attempt to politicize the digital agenda
is a really dangerous path and it is a
path which I think of was a no win
situation that the Europe would find
itself in these are binding laws that
the European commission is vested with
the task of carrying out ultimately some
of these cases we have individuals like
Max Rems who is looking at if the gdpr
is not uh observed those cases will be
taken to the European courts and
European courts don't negotiate with
President Trump and his administration
that is not political and I think the
commission needs to explain to the US
that it's hands are tight it's dealing
with binding legislation that it has to
enforce and it also has the support of
the parliament which it will lose if the
commission decides to back away from the
laws that were enacted by the parliament
but that doesn't mean that the Europeans
wouldn't need to take a hard look at
what needs to change I actually really
like the idea of radical change to to be
embraced because in many ways Europeans
have been too complacent the Europeans
cannot rely on America for the uh uh
security and there needs to be a a real
dedicated commitment to build these
other pillars of the tech ecos system
that will help the European companies
Thrive that will help Europeans become
digitally more Sovereign but abandoning
AI liability directive is not the path
forward to me and I think you said
exactly right Louisa that we also need
to understand that an alternative for EU
regulation is not no regulation it's 27
different regulations
that's much more harmful for growth for
non-european companies and European
companies alike so that I think is the
most important thing for us to
distinguish in this
conversation uh thank you and and
expanding a little bit I I think it's
it's funny so you're much more used to
that so I I write the newsletter for uh
almost it will be three years now and I
I I focus on legal aspects and more and
more I see myself writing about politics
it's funny I I see myself uh what seeing
a political so I it was not my goal but
it's so intertwined and I see more and
more with AI with data protection I
could more focus on the legal side and
now it's kind of mixed and I want to on
that area of geopolitics politics and
and and data Protection Law and digital
regulations so I wanted to bring again
dips it was something that so appears
suddenly and kind of shocked from a
legal level Market level political level
so it was so interesting to see so this
tsunami or uh earthquake whatever
whatever natural phenomena you want to
call dips uh so from focusing on on the
data protection side so especially for
those in the audience so dips is this uh
Chinese company so it's based in China
so they offer this open- Source
model uh and basically it became after
they launched so Nvidia it was a major
fallowing the US Stock Market because of
deeps launched a model that was almost
as powerful similar to open AIS o1 which
with a fraction of the investment so
there are discussions on what was the
amount of investment involved but it
looks like it was much much cheaper and
then there was
the the market impact that was all over
the news and then we started seeing the
the data protection implications so I
want to bring this discussion again
about the the legal side versus the the
political side so what we saw in the
last two weeks was each one I I don't
think it was all of them but many I'd
say more than 10 EU data protection
authorities started investigating one by
one deeps and when and if you read some
of them so they they sent questions so
the further questioning some of them
started off so the Italian data
protection authority for example they
they blocked dipsi uh then I think the
the Portuguese and Spanish there were
NOS pressuring the data protection
authorities to ban they also deep sick
in the
country and when you read the complaints
when you some of them they publish they
they they released some sort of press
release okay why are we Banning or why
are we investigating so was various
aspects of the privacy policy so the
type of data they collect how they they
store data how they collect so typical
gdpr issues and one of them was uh
storage so data transfers to China so I
know some people in the audience will
say you can still use deeps locally but
pay attention especially for those
that's not how uh usually people do it
so it's important to consider that most
people they will use it on the web so
yes they would be transferred to China
but going back to the to the data
protection uh discussion and geopolitics
so when when when reading those releases
it felt like the EU was being really uh
I say strict so going one by one of the
items of the privacy policy and and
saying this is why we are investigating
and if you compare other companies
privacy policy is not so different so I
say the main difference yes is the data
transfer to China this is different so
when you look at the big players So Meta
open AI so yes so the six case that was
transferring to China but some of the
other issues were similar in open AI or
meta and and other model so and that we
didn't see similar enforcement efforts
so do you think that what we saw and
just to compare in the US you you
probably saw also so NASA the US I think
the the government agencies and and
various levels they were also blocking
BPS so prohibited for national security
reasons they were afraid that person
data or sensitive data was going to be
transferred to China so do you saw those
uh investigation especially I'd say from
an EU perspective as politically driven
so not so much data protection and and
going back to your books so digital
Empires when we when we think about the
relationship between the EU Empire and
the Chinese Empire so how does it uh
flow well or or we are now seeing
started to seeing aention so EU versus
China as well so how do you see that yes
so I think there is a fundamental
tension because there is an
understanding of some logic of how
authoritarian regimes work it is harder
to uh maintain those firewalls between
companies and the government I think
this is the conversation why the the
Americans are now very troubled by what
to do with Tik Tok because Americans
just cannot believe that ultimately Tik
Tok would be able to refuse a request by
the Chinese Communist party to hand over
the data to that Communist party and
ultimately the question is too with deep
seek deep seek is not government owned
but the way there are Chinese laws that
oblig these companies to give the data
to the government for national security
reasons there there is a sort of it it
is more difficult for these companies
for instance to resist an order to hand
over data by somehow challenging these
request in independent courts because
the courts are not independent in China
so it also happens and Edward Snowden uh
who was a whistleblower in the United
States uh basically told to the world
how even the US government National
Security Agency was obtaining data from
the tech companies including data from
the Europeans and that led into the
ultimate falling off the the uh Safe
Harbor and then the uh the Privacy
framework uh between the um the that was
the basis for data transfers between the
US and the EU so we know that American
companies also hand data to the American
government but we also know many cases
where the US tech companies push back
and they take the US government to the
court and they refuse to hand over that
data and I just think there is still a
distinction up until at least very
recently when we felt that the checks
and balances are working in the US
system that the US is a democracy China
is an autocracy and they work in a
different way so I think there has been
an additional lay of concern in addition
to the Deep concerns they have been
about data transfers to to the us
including data ending up in the hands of
the national security agencies in the US
but there has been an additional level
of Suspicion because the opaqueness of
how the relationship between the Chinese
companies and Chinese governments uh is
structured and what ultimately the
Chinese companies could do to resist the
government's uh effort to obtain that
data so in that sense I am not sure what
I call it political I call it to some
extent realistic that I I think there
are genuine data privacy concerns I
don't think this is just a kind of an
anti- uh uh China um move by the data
protection agencies but I also recognize
that there can be concerns of a deeper
kind when you think at the ultimate end
uses of the data and the lack of
domestic checks and balances within the
Chinese
system and and still in that topic so
another uh element that I bring in this
dip sick discussion so I think for us
lawyers it's easier to see so dips is
based in China and as such so when a
company is based in a country it has to
respect local law so be beyond the the
the transfers and and this the
government looking at the the on the
personal data aspect or the data
protection aspect we have the censorship
aspect and I I see sometimes the public
debate many people maybe they're not
familiar so for example China has the
first generative AI law that China
enacted was in 2023 and if you look so
you can you you can type Google it there
there's translation and I also wrote
about it in the newsletter so article
four of this uh I forgot the name now of
the law but article four says that uh
provid so there's the different
terminology but basically providers and
users of generative AI system they have
to uh comply with this with this so
socialistic de so they they have to
respect so socialistic uh values so for
example when you're typing you're
prompting deeps if you're using the the
web version not locally uh hosted or or
the one that for example I saw the
perplexity recently they integrated dips
so if you're not using an American
company if you're going now the on the
web and using dips if you ask if you ask
for example is Taiwan a country the
answer will always be no it's it's an
integral part of China or if you ask uh
if you Trump prompting different ways
which which uh is the Chinese model the
Chinese socialism the best uh model for
the world to follow and the system will
answer in fact yes it's a great model
and if you ask the same question about
is the US capitalism great model and it
kind of will deviate the question and so
on so there is this idea for for Western
democracies at least us and Europe it's
it doesn't exist so we we I'm not
familiar of with an EU or uh EU country
or in the US it doesn't exist that the
the an AI company would have to build in
bias so this specific in depending on on
certain prompts the system will have to
answer in a way that we respect this
political uh worldview uh and I wanted
to ask you for me this this is new for
for especially now this is something new
in the sense that AI is being integrated
everywhere right we are seeing a
generative Ai and brother AI systems and
now ai agents and multi multi- agentic
system so whatever bias is built in will
suddenly get spread into other systems
and other it will affect us in different
ways and this this would be more of a
First Amendment perspective or free
speech so I wanted to ask you do you
think those and now we are navigating
those issues so the solution to that was
be to host the the the the AI model
locally so not use the the the Chinese
censorship so per you can do that for
perplexity but I wanted to hear from you
do you think though this type of loss
especially as seeing what how AI is
being integrated into everything so is
the West ready for that can we live
together so both so free speech from an
us perspective or fundamental rights
protection so from I I think from an EU
EU perspective it's not right to say
that Tai one doesn't exist or or if you
ask specific minorities and China the
the system will will will lie will say
the the Chinese version which might not
be according to the EU view of
protection of fundamental rights and so
on so how do you see that so from a
digital regulation perspective uh are we
ready for that those challenges so can
the the the US Empire and the EU Empire
live together with the this aor more I
would say censorship based types of
rules or are we going to face in the
next month something that okay maybe uh
we have to rethink that relationship
what are your thoughts on that yeah I
think the question is and and I take
this on in digital Empires whether the
empires can coexist whether one of them
ultimately prevails and and I talk a lot
about the conflicts what happens when
the empires are colliding and how
difficult it is for global companies
navigate the different rules of
different Empires so you have um US law
enforcement authorities requesting
Microsoft to hand over data that is part
of the law enforcement investigations in
the US but the data is located in the
service in Ireland and protected by the
gdpr and the Irish authorities say you
cannot hand over the data that the US
agencies are requiring you to hand over
this happened a lot also when the
Chinese competitor to Uber Didi listed
in New York Stock Exchange and was
requested to give uh information to us
authorities to protect American
investors that the Chinese government
was adamant that cannot be handed over
so sometimes companies are actually
forced to choose that you cannot at the
same time comply with the European and
American rules or American and Chinese
rules so I think those are the hardest
issues whether companies really feel
they actually need to choose the markets
and we have seen many US companies
abandon the Chinese market Google is not
there uh Facebook is not available in
China and X is not there which is why
now many of these Tech uh Giants
including Elon Musk is saying why should
we allow Tik Tok to operate in the US
because there's no reciprocity and when
they operate in the US they uh
compromise the values of the American
Digital model meaning uh we believe in
free speech uh we also believe in the
Chinese government not influencing the
algorithms to basically engage in
propaganda that would influence then
Americans or then compromise US National
Security interests by harvesting the
data of the Americans and ultimately Tik
Tok potentially giving it to the
government so I think those suggest that
we don't necessarily see the Empire
coexisting but let me Louisa take an
example from AI space so I think it is
very unlikely that there would be some
kind of a global treaty on rights around
AI China is not going to give up on mass
surveillance they are not going to agree
or not to use AI powered facial
recognition in a way that they currently
are using so that's not a domain where
the Europeans and Chinese and Americans
could necessarily agree but there should
be and that's why I so regret the tone
of of the Paris AI Summit there should
be questions around AI safety that are
not
ideological that don't really compromise
the message of the Chinese Communist
party where I think there are questions
that really pertain to the the safety of
the entire Humanity where it doesn't
matter whether you are American whether
you Brazilian whether you are Chinese
whether you're Indian whether you're
African whether you're European we
ultimately need to make sure for
instance the AI doesn't get into the
hands of uh ill motivated non-government
actors we need to be able to think about
militarization of AI so using AI in in
uh military conflicts so even at the
height of the Cold War they were Arms
Control treaties between the Soviets and
the United States so we need to be able
to to find some domains where we still
can accomplish some degree of
international cooperation to make AI
safe and especially in the domains where
those conversations are not bued down by
the kind of ideological differences
where the empires I think continue to
collide I think this is an excellent way
to conclude our conversation and before
uh we we we close and I thank the
audience so Anu is an absolute Pioneer
and this book again if you haven't read
you should so you anticipated so much of
what we are seeing now and this is such
a timely discussion a timely reading so
I want to ask you what's your next book
so help us uh see the future through
your Visionary ey so what what are you
planning a next book so what should be
paying attention to so how we navigate
this this uh tsunami of news and AI race
and and how do we understand better
what's going on and especially if you
have any planned book upcoming books or
what should be focusing on uh so I am
not yet working on on uh a a new book
but I think it's actually and we talked
about this briefly I think we Face such
degree of uncertainty that it's very
hard for me to see where the world is
two years from now and that's what you
normally when I started working on
digital Empires I knew this was going to
be a very pertinent conversation maybe I
didn't yet see the decree to which AI is
shaping our societies but all these
digital tensions they were there to be
to elevated to the conversation so in
that sense I think the timing was easier
with that book now I think we we I feel
like the ground underneath us is moving
and given just the speed with which the
United States is changing its own
constitutional structure institutional
makeup regulatory State and influence in
the rest of the world and president
Trump has been in power for was it three
weeks I mean four years is a long time
so it's very hard for me to predict
where the world is going so I think
right now I'm going to work on academic
articles and and make that sort of build
a conversation with these blogs but
there are certain big trends that I
think it's important for us to think
about one is that we we are certainly
seeing a sort of rethinking of the the
role of the state and the market so I
don't think we are going back to the
neoliberal world and those institutions
the WTO of the world so we I like to
work do some work in in envisioning that
post neoliberal world we are seeing the
state back in we seeing more industrial
policy if you see part of that AI race
the states investing much more through
subsidies and this kind of economic
nationalism so in many ways I think we
we see a different future and to try to
help us understand what that future will
look like is something that I'm
certainly very very interested in so I'm
reading a lot on Industrial policy I'm
reading a lot on sort of rethinking the
state and the markets the role of
companies but it's very confusing if you
look at you don't even know whether it's
Elon Musk or president Trump who is
running the United States at this point
so we see that companies penetrating in
many ways the the public sphere with
they outsid influence but then we see
the state really asserting itself in the
marketplace so I'm interested in those
Dynamics and and we'll see whether that
will be a book but but I just think it
is such a
fascinating time for a scholar it's a
troubling time but my goal as a scholar
is to sort of provide more of an
analytical framework to try to make
sense of this fast moving
World amazing and I I'm looking forward
to sitting again with you with you when
your new book about this state and
corporate power intertwined book it
looks like it will be something like
that so I hope to see it again and we
can have another talk like this thank
you so much and it was such an
enlightened conversation I think the the
the audience uh is is also super happy I
was reading the comments now they're
they're really enjoying our conversation
