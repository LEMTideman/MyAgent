welcome everyone to the 12th edition of
our live talk today I'm here with AIA
gal and Nia and we are going to talk
about what to expect in privacy
2024 so this will be a very Dynamic
session uh we are going to talk about
different topics if you saw in the
description we're going stop talk about
the hottest topics in privacy the
challenging issues that most or some
companies or most companies are going to
have to deal with uh also personal tips
that me and each one of the are going to
share with you uh to help you be a
successful uh person or privacy
professional dealing with privacy issues
in 2024 so we are going to start with
introductions uh uh so you this I'm here
with three rock star so odia G and I'm
sure you already know them but as I did
in previous sessions I think uh people's
stories and Journeys are important so
I'd like to invite the guests to share a
little bit quickly about what you can
share about your company and what to do
and what took you to the Privacy field
so what was the I quickly tell and and
also for those that are thinking about
and starting or transition into privacy
what was the the the click that you had
or something that is special about
privacy that made you want to to stay in
field before we start make sure to
subscribe to L's newsletter so that you
get a notice about the upcoming Live
Events and also the weekly analysis and
privacy
techi and yeah so let's let's start so
let's start with AIA can you please tell
me a little bit about you what you do
today and what took you to the Privacy
field sure hi everybody nice to be here
happy New Year um I'm odia I am a
partner and chair of gdpr compliance and
international privacy at Fox Rothchild
uh which means that I'm a partner at a
law firm so we do everything I don't
need to talk about how well we do um my
practice is really 100% privacy
compliance and so what I do is really I
look at technology I look at products
and services and data uses and figure
out what um data privacy data protection
laws apply to it and how to go about
doing it in a way that's compliant um
the way that and you know from the title
you can tell that I do a lot of us
privacy but I also do a lot of European
privacy which is increasingly coming in
handy with the US laws that are modeling
themselves after gdpr um how did I get
into this I actually did uh I don't know
I think one of the first ever um kind of
uh remote learning Tech
llms back when this was like books were
shipped to my house kind of situation
but it was Tech specific and it was uh I
did a bunch of it and Telecom but also
European data protection and so I was in
got interested in that and started doing
the gdpr piece and then kind of um you
know had to convince clients that in the
US that this was a thing right back in
in the when in the US privacy was oh you
do data breach no so and what's keeping
me and what I think is a tip for people
that are or a consideration for people
that are um getting into this field is
that it's really very Dynamic and very
fast- based and so that has that has
pros and cons kind of built into it
because you can't really rest on your
laurels you you know rest a little bit
suddenly Everything Has Changed there is
the FTC issued a new blog post you know
there's a new cju decision and basically
you're giving um outdated advice to
clients and for me you know one I'm very
curious and I really like learning and
two it's really important to me to kind
of really give good advice and so the
the plus here is that it's very Dynamic
and fast changing and the the pro and
the con is it's very Dynamic and very
fast changing and therefore you need to
keep up with it all the time and so um I
call it privacy fomo and um and I try to
contribute uh my privacy fomo on to the
community so I do a lot of posting of
content on LinkedIn and I welcome you
guys to connect with
me thank you so MIA
please hi um thanks for having us Lisa
I'm Nia castelli I'm the co-founder and
head of legal for checks and so checks
is an AI powered uh compliance platform
from Google and so I've been um at
Google for about 10 years um and prior
to um being a part of checks I was
product councel for the Google Play
Store and so you know I've been
practicing for over 20 years but um and
obviously privacy is always an issue for
lawyers in some aspect but it really
wasn't until gdpr um that I my focus
really uh shifted uh to privacy you know
as we all know it was a seismic shift
companies were trying to figure out the
law figure out how to apply the law
maybe they're still doing that um but um
you know it was challenging and you know
from a personal perspective you know I'm
very privacy s sensitive um but on the
other hand I love technology and I'm I'm
really passionate about Innovation and
so that has led my motivation to
advising in the space um because I want
to make things better right to help us
to continue to do these amazing things
and um expand technology and its uses
and make the world a better place how
can we do that and still preserve
privacy so that that has been my focus
um and so in the last four years I kind
of pivoted a bit um from purely legal
advising to actual product development
so along with my co-founder Fergus
Harley and our team um we've created and
brought to Market we created and brought
to Market checks uh we announced it um
publicly in
2022 um and we're currently in closed
beta and you know really the reason why
I decided to do this because you know
for the lawyers in the call like we're
always putting out fires right that's
what we're focusing on that's what we're
helping and I just you know during the
gdpr compliance phase um you know when
it was first rolling out and just in
generally working um in the mobile app
app space I saw the challenges that all
companies of all sizes faced um keeping
you know bringing their mobile app into
compliance and you know zodia said
keeping it there because it's constantly
changing right these requirements um and
I thought you know is there a better way
can we do something to kind of help
there and that's where uh cheex was born
so we're really excited about um rolling
it out to General availability this uh
this year so more to come in this space
thank you
G thank you for having me so um yeah my
name is G ringel I'm the co-founder and
CEO at mine uh in short what we do we
are data privacy and governance
platforms that powers legal it and
engineering team to essentially automate
many of their daily activities around
being compliant to different privacy
regulations or you know building a very
good uh or great privacy program our
vision is to become the single source of
data tooth within the organiz ation so
basically providing a realtime view of
what systems we are using as a company
and what types of data we keep inside
and actually this is also what brought
me to the Privacy field so my background
is H cyber security I did that for uh
more than 15 years I had a short uh four
and a half years career as a venture as
as a venture capitalist as well I uh I
invested in invested in dozen startups
uh in Israel and essentially uh I'm a
dat geek um and when I saw the gdpr
coming into life in 2018 I thought that
hey as as a as a human being as an end
user I'm using the internet all day long
and I have no idea where my data is and
I wanted to really learn what companies
are doing with my data and when I spoke
with companies I learned that a lot of
companies don't have any idea what data
they keep or what data they collect uh
and I think that I really wanted to take
my cyber security and data experience
and use it for privacy and trying to
create a better uh equality better
internet but a better privacy future if
you would want so this is my story thank
you for sharing yeah oia and gal now I
didn't say before so we are here I think
I would say the audience is 70% nerds
I'm kidding privacy professionals so I I
I recommend now we are going to start
hardcore uh privacy Trends
recommendations and challenges so I
recommend you do like me you have a pen
and traditional no computer pen and
paper to take notes because it's going
to be dynamic and fast and uh unvaluable
advice here so if you you have time now
so go grab traditional pen and paper to
take note and now we're going to to
discuss so I ask each one so odia G and
yeah to be like let's try to be dynamic
and not like let's say bullet points or
or let's say up to maximum four minutes
and and really I I know we so so that
for the audience so the idea is that you
have like actionable advice you have
like so we you saw you heard now the
journeys and the stories so we come from
different background I forgot to
introduce myself so so my story quickly
uh so my my my connection to privacy I
sorry I forgot that so it all begins
very academic my masters I was doing my
masters at T University and then I had
two courses in privacy and I say wow
this is really different and interesting
from Mostly from an academic perspective
really deep new and interdisciplinary
and I've always loved
interdisciplinary uh topics and then
there came an opportunity for a PhD in
privacy it was like sponsored by the
European Union something very
International very interesting to to I'm
as a lawyer I was going to be
interacting with Engineers so it was
everything very everything that I like
traveling and interdisciplinary and then
I started my PhD like 100% it was a
privacy and us so privacy and usability
and then I that's what my story so
that's why I started writing a PhD in
this project specifically about privacy
and then I really dive deep and and then
I wanted to do more than PhD and then a
newsletter and these talks everything so
my my my my story is different so what I
wanted to share is that you see here so
OD Nia G and me we have different
Journeys different points of view even
though everyone is more or less let's
say in the Privacy field so working
somehow with privacy we see things from
different angles so that's why I think
it's very rich for you in the audience
because you can you see the how probably
I think there are going to be some
intersections but we we see things
different so we have different
occupations within privacy so I think
it's going to be an important advice to
all of you so pen and paper ready let's
start now with Nia so Nia what is h for
in your opinion what are the hottest
privacy Topics in 2024 and why do you
think they're going to be uh impactful
especially yeah for private
professionals and companies yeah you're
with you yeah I think no one's going to
be surprised that I'm gonna start with
AI right not sure we could could even
address this topic without that but I
think more specifically I think the
thing that was um that I've kind of
owned in on you know you talk about the
Nerds and all of us right I think we're
all privacy and some of us legal legal
privacy nerds but um the the use of of
public personal data and foundational
models and what does that mean and where
do you get it and all of the different
concepts that that fall into that not
just privacy obviously there are other
legal um considerations but I think you
know from a true nerd perspective I
think that's going to be an exciting
area whether it's making the argument
for the use of it and why it makes sense
and why it's okay or you know if that
doesn't work um finding ways to ensure
that it can still happen so that we can
continue to produce um you know the
amazing um you know outcomes and and
continue to advance this technology so I
think that's going to be a a big topic
um I don't know how many you want me to
share but I'm going to do one more um
and I think another big topic uh in one
that I'm I don't want to say concerned
about but you know worried a little bit
is you know the rush to enact AI
legislation related legislation and how
it will impact privacy legislation I
think we've have been having this
constant you know speaking from a US
perspective you know many of the States
you know are rolling out their own
versions and we're still hoping at some
point for a a combining Federal approach
um to privacy but you know is there's
going to be a change and re refocusing
on this and is that going to make um you
know privacy regulation more fractured
and more difficult to to understand and
comply with and um ensure that you're
you're um approaching this properly I
think that's going to be be a big topic
to see you know how um Regulators are
approaching this so if we would say two
bullet points it would be um AI so
issues privacy issues in Ai and also uh
regulating the rush to regulate y thank
you yes so and you g what would be your
uh hot privacy topics for
2024 so uh I I went to the immediate
suspect as well which is AI I decided to
tackle that from from two different
angles one of them is similar to Nia so
essentially the upcoming uh AI
regulations so the first AI Act and the
White House also um um published like a
framework for that so I'm I'm excited to
see what that would bring uh essentially
uh around that I know that we're already
speaking with different gc's and uh many
are trying to understand you know what
to do with that there is a I don't want
to say panic but there is some sort of
uh uh a lot of question marks like what
to do with that uh I would focus for
2024 on um trying to come up with
practical
um activities that we can do in order to
prepare for that uh whether it's
understanding what AI assets we have
within the
organization um and understand the risk
around it this is something that we can
really understand uh and the other side
of the AI that I wanted to raise is
basically how can we leverage a uh AI or
geni as a privacy differentiator so how
can we use geni to boost some of the
Privacy activities or even to even build
a better privacy program or a more
comprehensive and one example that I
wanted to take from other fields is the
co-pilot uh example that uh many um
other use cases of of jni is to do some
sort of a co-pilot which is some sort of
a private J GPT or privacy assistant if
you would want that you know we can
train him on different company data
related to the Privacy program and then
we can start communicating with that uh
co-pilot to ask questions around the
Privacy program or even to uh perform
tasks uh instead of us so this is like
how can we leverage ni to our benefits
and not afraid of that and I think the
other Trend which is started last year
and I think would get stronger this year
is how can we shift left privacy to
engineering I think that uh many uh the
same as it happens in the security space
and again this is my background so uh
things that happen there usually goes to
other uh Fields especially privacy but
how can we train and educate engineer to
think about privacy when they are
writing the code uh whether it's within
Cloud environment or any other things
and uh while they are writing their
algorithms even AI algorithms or just
the software in general how they can we
train them to think about privacy
practices when they are writing the code
and not
afterwards thank you g so it was there
three bullet if we would summarize would
be AI in general and then leveraging AI
for privacy and then shifting privacy
left so now now AIA you're you're in a
in a more you can say I too but you're I
I just put you last one because AIA in
the backstage she told me she had a very
long list so she was the one uh she can
attack back if she has yeah I had
redundancies in case of failure so I'm
not going to do AI um so I I'm going to
go with the following the first thing I
think is this the concept that's going
to be big is going to be um sensitive
information and various uses of
sensitive information so sensitive
information first of all um genetics uh
genetic data we've seen the recent um
you know aftermath of uh the a security
incident in the space the FTC issued a
blog post on Friday
highlighting its expectations and
reiterating the fact that it's going to
enforce um facial recognition and
Biometrics we saw the FDC WR Aid
decision from a couple of weeks ago that
is also you know the use of Biometrics
by Ai and all of the issues including
bias and um and the reliability of the
AI and vetting thirdparty vendors um
facial recognition um and then location
uh we are that there's an ongoing uh
litigation by the FTC versus kava with
respect to sensitive locations and
increasingly in the post dos laws right
the significance of location so I think
sensitive information um with the
heightened requirements attached to it
under us laws right the the requirement
for consent or opt out the requirement
for a dpia um is going to be a big deal
in 2024 I think a second one is
employees and employee surveillance so
this concept this a little bit dovetails
also into AI but the concept of
employees and employee surveillance
specifically with the aid of AI or not
uh seems to be an issue of um uh that is
there's a lot of attention to both in
the Biden executive order that got
mentioned um also in the draft automated
decision-making regs from California
they're specifically talking about using
AI for surveillance there is a New York
City law with respect to Ai and hiring
so I think employee hiring promotion
surveillance and the data protection
ramifications of that are going to be
important um and then finally just which
is is CCPA enforcement so you know the
cppa got the green light start enforcing
in July the regs are coming out of
hibernation with the function in
March um the Attorney General they also
they're all started enforcing um the CPR
and so be and we're going to see we're
going to see these enforcements in 2024
we haven't actually seen them yet and so
I think that's going to be a big deal uh
because we're going to get some um one
you know some kind of RoR scale
reporting but also kind of Lessons
Learned and things that companies can
focus
on thank you so we have sensitive
information so genetic facial location
employee surveillance and enforcement so
CCPA CPR Amendment Etc and other types
of
enforcement and so my case I would just
uh I want to bring AI but just to
specify some subtopics within AI I don't
think we we neither ni or G spoke so
first that this one so spoke the the
idea of article six of gdpr so
lawfulness of processing so for those
not aware article six talks about you
have to have a a legitimate cause to
process data according to gdpr so is I
think in my view and I've spoken a lot
about that it's unclear still we can AI
training can be legitimate interest and
even if it can be legitimate interest so
how can we be transparent and fair when
we are communicate that to communicating
that to users so I think this uh one
thing of AI and privacy under also uh
privacy infringement so how do you
communicate with to users that they can
be infringing others people's privacy
when they use the output of chpt or any
other uh AI application also AI
companions I think it's a fascinating
topic and I had this conversation with
Professor r k so all those replica and
characteri so children talking with uh
those AI Companions and what are the
Privacy implications so legislation
privacy legislation for children is a
bit more strict so and there will be all
types of exchange of sensitive data with
AI so how how is going privacy is going
to deal with that we had a case of the
the Italian data protection Banning
replica and then didn't ban anymore but
now there are this these applications
are super popular and I've always I
check them in the Apple Store Etc and
they're they're growing and I I see a
lot of data protection issues there uh
so one is AI and the other one that I
think it's super important and maybe
because maybe I'm biased because I pay a
lot of attention to that and I teach
that and and the boot camp is about that
too so dark patterns and not only uh in
so dark patterns have been trending
since at least 2022 so it's not new but
if you think what some changes so you
see Ai and advertising are are are
bringing new challenges and with them we
can have also dark pattern related
challenge so we so there's going to be
uh there's going to be no more uh third
part cookies in Chrome until the end of
the year so how are those new forms of
behavior advertising work out and how do
can we think about designing and being
fair and being uh uh transparent with
users so I think both Ai and advertising
because of the changes that are already
happening I think they are going to be
also design related so dark patterns
related challenges so this would be my
issue so AI the specific issues of
privacy in Ai and dark patterns so the
second topic of today so we spoke about
the hottest privacy topics now I think
it's another very important one and I
think I put together the the two next
topics so what will be the most
challenging privacy issues for business
so not the hottest but the on the ones
that businesses will probably have
difficulty navigating and so this is the
first part of the question and the
second part is how do you how do guest
we recommend that companies can deal
with it so I I'm putting together the
one the next question so the main
challenges and what would be your tip to
to private professionals and companies
on how they can navigate so now let's
start with
AIA so I think that I mean from what I'm
seeing companies struggling with um I
think that uh one struggle that I think
hopefully is going to be less for us and
um is that we we lawyers are going to
have and privacy professionals are maybe
maybe going to have less of a struggle
um convincing companies that this is an
important thing because this like part
of selling selling what we do and why
has been a constant part of my practice
and has not been a constant practice of
the people that do exactly what I do in
in Europe right so this like
prerequisite of no no because I we I had
conversation with colleagues and I said
oh this is going to be really good this
decision because I can use it as ammo
because I've been telling clients to
revise their privacy notice and I'm like
no we don't need a deep dive you really
do so this concept they're like oh you
need to do that I think this is going to
be less and the and and because because
of the what what we mentioned which is
the enforcement is going to be the FTC
enforcement we're already seeing we're
going to see a lot out of California
we're going to see some things that are
going to be incurable in Colorado
Connecticut Etc so we're going to see
enforcement so I think we're we're the
more companies are actually you know um
understanding that there is a challenge
the more the challeng is become a parent
so you know when clients don't turn to
me for things you know I could think
that hey this is fine but it's not fine
so for example VSS or Comm consumer
requests I think that's going to be a
big challenge I think it's definitely
going to be an issue once the once we
see the results of the employer sweep
out of California we're going to see a
bunch of stuff happening with employers
because suddenly employees are going to
be like oh this is nice and I think
there are a lot of companies in the US
that have never really dealt with this
situation on Moss I mean they have dealt
with it because you know the labor laws
give you rights but you know nobody
really paid not a lot of people paid
attention to it so I think that's one
either on the employee side or the
consumer side we also know this Dove
tales with enforcement priorities
because The Regulators have said that
they're focusing on do not sell and on
delete so that we're going to see
enforcement we're going to see a ramp
off so I think that's one big challenge
the other challenge that I'm going to
say because I'm going to leave the AI to
everybody else but the other challenge
that I'm going to name is the dpas I
think that um uh companies really you
know you don't know um you don't know
what it is until you've started to do
one and it's a lot of work and it's a
lot of questions and we send we talk
about this with clients and we get
answers like oh can we just have a
generic answer or can we just take to
say this generally or you know or my my
one of my favorites is which other
vendors did you consider for this
technology we didn't uh consider anybody
else um things like that like these are
things I think that are going to flush
out a lot of the issues in the
processing a lot of lack of transparency
and silos in companies a lot of lack of
cooperation and lack of transparencies
from vendors right um because we're
still not you know I literally had one
vendor tell a client you the DPA is your
problem like I can't do it without the
information what do you expect me to do
here um so I think that is going to be
uh that's going to be a challenge and I
think it's again it kind of corresponds
with the AI stuff because a lot of the
new um things that are heightened risk
are AI so you need to do these risk
assessments for AI and I think that's
going to be a big
challenge thank you AIA so now
G so I chose something uh basic I chose
data mapping I think that uh every
conversation that I'm having with any
anyone within the organization whether
it's legal privacy it engineering
security anyone everyone is talking
about data mapping for me data mapping
is two faults um Step number one is as
an organization we need to know what
we're dealing with so essentially what
systems we have within the organization
A system can be any SAS app that we're
using or any asset that we have within
our Cloud so whether it's a database a
data L A Storage bucket or any uh email
Marketing System CRM HR System payment
jgpt whatever so finding these systems
it's it's very hard um and the second uh
part of data mapping is after we know
what we're dealing with we need to scan
these systems and really understand what
types of data we keep there and I think
that that you know doing that is the
fundamental or the key pillar that
serves different stakeholders within the
organization and I think that the the
most challenging part is not just doing
that is having that updated real time
and continuous so surprisingly uh many
of the companies that uh that that that
we're speaking with are still doing that
the manual oldfashioned uh spreadsheet
questioners way which has uh three major
problems one is a coverage problem
second is an accuracy problem and most
importantly the third problem is that
it's very static meaning we did that
data mapping exercise today and we are
happy but the next morning um someone
within the organization can use a new
vendor or existing vendor can start
collecting new personal data and no one
knows about that uh and I think that uh
just to give interesting statistics uh
anytime that we help companies automate
that data mapping approach uh for the
average organization of 1,000 employees
we typically find
1,600 systems again A system can be SAS
or any Cloud asset which is insanely
high and what is more surprising is that
40% of that number so 40% out of 1,600
which is more than 600 systems were
unknown right or as we like to call it a
a shadow it uh meaning there the there
are 600 systems that no one knows about
they didn't go get into the dpia that
that odia uh talked about or didn't
really handled uh in in the D process uh
so I think that uh as as a as a true
challenge having that data mapping real
time and continuous and automated which
this is like the important part is the
key pillar that unlocks anything else
within the organization so whether it's
DS dpia Roa uh even even AI related uh
things so I think this is the the key
part and and how to do it I think just
automation I have no I I I haven't found
any other way in you know doing that um
quicker or or or like easier so I think
that if we can automate a lot of the
daily repetitive and manual tasks around
the heavy lifting of doing data mapping
we can really power and unlock all the
other challenges or all all the other
requirements that we are obligated by
different laws uh to do so I think this
is uh I try to choose something very
basic
thank you go now
Nia so I was going to go a different way
more Ai and how difficult I think the
biggest issue will be about the merid of
Regulation right in the Privacy space
and how do you comply with that but I
wanted to go back and like my third
bullet point for like the most um the
hottest issues is what I hope will be a
hot issue which is children's privacy I
think we saw you know the announcement
in December about um the ca's not of
proposed rulemaking um and I will say I
expected I had hoped for more robust um
guidance and information in that space
given how much um feedback was given and
all of the hearings that were done and
and input that was provided from the
public but I think there were enough
changes in here that um are things that
uh you know companies need to stand up
and take notice um and sort of going to
what gal was talking about like the
point about now there's heightened
requirements around disclosure and use
of persistent identifiers if you don't
know what's happening in your systems
right in your mobile app or in other
places um it's difficult to ensure that
that's happening um or even just being
you know what Odio was saying like
trying to you know advise your clients
to ensure that they're updating their
privacy policies because now there's a
heightened requirement about being more
clear about your retention policies
right with respect to Children's data um
but coming back to you know what I focus
on with is and just like I'll you know
how can we leverage technology to make
these things um you know easier simpler
and actually improve the likelihood
you're going to comply because in order
to protect children you actually need
some of their data right so it's a Hobs
and St it's like how do we actually do
this um but you know I think that there
are opportunities for um you know for us
to leverage these advancements and
Technology to make this um possible in a
way that preserves the privacy of
children but help helps companies get to
where they need because you know as a
mom I want my kids to be able to use
technology and not have to sacrifice um
you know their data or more than data
than they want to um so anyway I hope um
that is a Hot Topic and I think it will
be a challenge too because some of the
expansion under the proposed rul making
I think especially around evidence of
child directedness and you know three
and four yearolds are using everything
right technology pads apps Etc and so
what does that mean for you know child
adjacent um I'll say it um types of um
companies products Services um and you
know what does that mean for you and I
think I will say the last thing I want
is for you know companies to do less um
in terms of providing this because I do
think it's a positive um uh positive
experience for children technology can
be right and all that it offers so we
don't want that there to be a a
Contracting of of services offered um to
children but you know this is hard and
it's risky um and I think in you asked
like you know what can businesses do to
prepare I said this along with like the
other point I wanted to make about you
know just there's so much regulation
right um you know whether it's just in
the Privacy space you know and like um
you know the states as I've mentioned
continuing um to expand you know I think
we started um the year with five states
with an AC law and we're ending with
around 20 um so it's it's happening
quickly and thankfully you know there's
there's only small there tend to be only
small differences and I think in terms
of how um companies comply as looking
for you know the overarching framework
and applying those right um of what's
required but um it's still difficult to
track because it's changing so you know
as gal said you know Levering technology
um like you know our products that can
allow you to see across the board what
what you're doing what's required and
you know more focused on what still
needs what gaps you still need to feed I
think are the best way to approach this
because spreadsheets just they aren't
going to work at some point they get
outdated they you know they get
voluminous and then they're not even
useful um and then when we add AI on top
of that well which clearly we'll have
you know we've seen with the EU AI act
you know privacy implication so it's
another Lev layer of um a requirements
that are tacked on or even like you know
like Washington State passing um the My
Health my data act that OD alluded to
you know like they it incl it's focused
on you know sensitive data but they
privacy implications and we think about
Biometrics so you may not be in the
health space but you still have um data
that may have these you know that may
trigger these um regulatory requirements
so it's tough and it's challenging and
so like I said U my recommendation would
be to look for uh tools you know
platforms you know things out there that
can help make this
easier thank you so before I share mine
I I happy to see that we are all sharing
like Pro technology uh opinions because
privacy professionals sometimes have
this reputation of being anti technology
it will be everything no results or an
anti- AI and that's not the way and
that's that doesn't need to be like that
what I like that that I heard a lot of
using like leveraging technology I think
it's interesting I also I'm in this
sense pragmatic and I I believe in that
also from my perspective some of the
it's aligned with what Nia and a just
said about the the challenge of keeping
up with the regulatory background and if
we think and and yo was mentioning the
the the state law so let's if you if we
remember 2016 was the the big thing was
the gdpr wow let's focus on this new
text and and new consent and new
principles and and then now fast forward
it's a lot if you compare the number of
losss we had the 10 year or less than 10
years ago with what happens now in the
speed and not and so and there are two
two aspects of this complexity first is
the amount so we have not only a privacy
now ai in in to some extent it will
intersect so AI act and also other forms
at least especially in Europe uh that
other forms of tech regulation that we
have privacy intersection so the DSA the
data act um also H so we were talking
about the numbers so the state loss
there will be probably more more loss
this year in the US so all over the
world there is this pressure not only
regulate privacy but regulate Ai and not
only LW so we have uh best practices U
industry standards ISO requirements
reports and to some EX so if if what we
seeing today with AI so we don't have
many examples and the AI Act is not into
for didn't enter into Force yet and we
have reports so everybody's is guiding
themselves with certification and ISO
and reports so it's it adds new layers
of complexity where being compliant
being privacy compant doesn't mean only
loss means keeping up with reports and
standards and best practice I think it's
also in in breath and and also in
different types of layers of complexity
H in terms of uh how to prepare and it's
also connected to what MIA said I think
there's a lot of interdisciplinarity as
maybe you're not a health uh Health tech
company but you have biometric or
probably you have bi some sort of
location biometric sensitive data
children's data so interdisciplinarity
and also in in terms of design and the
topic one of my favorite topics dark
pattern and how privacy is is also
connected to product and design so I
think it it also shows that companies
should think of privacy and I think Al
this is changing already what I would
say now is not necessarily as it was in
2016 I would say it's privacy was very
much associated with the legal
department so a legal person that will
learn privacy laws and will advise about
privacy so it's changing and it's
getting so more and more I see companies
having like privacy people not
necessarily lawyers speaking with
product teams on a daily basis this is
essential because and if we think about
our patterns and design this is obvious
when you're designing an interface if
there will be interaction with the user
there will be potential uh privacy
issues and a product person will not NE
before the product person did not have
to know anything about privacy and today
I think it maybe a bias but I think all
departments should have some notion of
privacy so in in to some extent everyone
should be everyone in Tech should be uh
should know some much more about privacy
than that it would be expected five
years ago or 10 years ago because of
this interdisciplinarity because of this
idea of privacy by Design and and and
embedding uh privacy into the designing
from the beginning so how are you going
to do it if uh you need a legal
department or someone from the Privacy
department so it needs to be much more
spread on the company and I and I think
slowly at least big Tech is is is I see
that when I talk with larger companies
they the structure of privacy teams is
much more spread and and within every
Department which I think it makes sense
and it it also helps to implement uh and
it facilitates the way when when you're
talking about privacy compliance so I
think in so how to the pragmatic aspect
so is this idea of spreading privacy not
only one privacy department but help
training and helping people to
understand how privacy affects their
department so I'm always obsessed with
that because I think that's how we add
systems to compliance and it will help
it will help uh avoid hopes that you
didn't see it or nobody noticed nobody
thought that that it was relevant or
there is a hole there and perhaps as G
was saying perhaps data mapping will
help but maybe if if you you invite
everyone to to this privacy discussion
it will be better so this this is my
point of view so for now for for our
last question today so what is your
personal tip for privacy professionals
who want to navigate 20 2024
successfully so less about companies and
about what companies should do or
legislation but more about the people so
people here in the audience so I guess
from what I saw in the comments and and
and when I saw people comenting the
LinkedIn event people most people here
are privacy professionals so what would
be like from privacy professional to
privacy professional we are here as we
saw odia ni and G we are from we have
different perspectives what would be
your personal tip to help them navigate
successfully so let's start with G this
time so you mentioned not something
related to technology something can just
not F focusing like from person to
person not like to the business you know
like to the other person got it I think
that the main challenge that uh I'm
seeing is how can we leverage the entire
organization to work towards privacy uh
unfortunately and this is something that
I'm trying to change every day is
prioritizing privacy activities any type
of activities within the organization is
very hard right because privacy is not
considered yet as a revenue generator
right uh we need to take Engineers we
need to take it we need to take security
we need to take a lot of resources from
the organization to build the
infrastructure or to develop all kind of
tools or things to really help meet with
different requirements by the law and
unfortunately it's very even it's even
more um harder to convince the
leadership the management uh and and I
think that uh what I'm thinking is uh
what I'm like recommending is if we can
drive a better discussion within the
company and as a CEO I can say that it
has to come from the leadership from the
management and even from the board to
start talking about the importance of
you know privacy and the importance of
different activities that we need to
apply within the organization again I I
will keep saying that data mapping but
you know that data mapping behind the
scen is to create a a one source of data
truth so as the company grows a lot of
different teams dependent on
understanding what types of systems and
data we have within the organization and
why should each one of them create their
own you know their own view for it let's
all work together let's all collaborate
together on creating you know one place
that we can all leverage and you know
count on and and take it then and each
one of us can solve different you know
business pain points but I think it's
all start with you know um um convincing
you know the importance of privacy and
you know um treat privacy as a real
differentiator as a real brand uh
differentiator as a trust elevator and
not as a compliance you know checkbox
that we need to do um I I keep hearing
that let's do the the minimal effort
right or the best effort that we can get
and you know uh move on to do other
things I think it has to be more than
that thank you girl
Nia yeah plus one to everything gal said
is about this I think we have to you
like part of this great Network we have
um in the Privacy space is sharing best
practices about how do you to doing
exactly that right like how can we make
the case that's compelling because at
the end of the day it's about the bottom
line so whether that has been what we've
talked about today which is you know
bringing in um Technical Solutions that
allow these things to be done more
efficiently um and you know and
therefore we can show how with less
effort or minimal effort we can get to
Greater compliance right and the benefit
being as you mentioned gal that you know
we can position and Market you know you
can position and Market your um company
as this is a differentiator in the fact
that you have these best practices in
place and your customers clients can
have confidence um that you're doing
that and we know you know with the
constant changes that are happening
transparency is the Hallmark you're
going to have to be able to communicate
um to your customers your external
stakeholders what you're doing and and
um and why you're doing it for and be H
and you're going to be held accountable
because you know there is this uptick
and enforcement that's coming not just
for the big guys but for the small folks
too um and so it's just a matter of time
so you want to start doing this and
pushing this so that your company can be
best POS positioned to not be on the
back foot and be able to succeed in the
face of this um and I think you know for
the people themselves you know my uh tip
was going to be um read read and read
some more and also listen um to podcasts
because things are changing so quickly
like monthly even at times you know
whether it be the changes in the
technology and what you know folks are
using um and companies are bringing to
market the changes in the laws um but
even more so the change in the focus of
the day I think I don't know if in 2022
maybe we thought we would all be so
hyperfocused on AI it's not new but we
didn't know that everyone was going to
start talking about it and you know
regulations and best practices and and
questions we going to be be focused on
this so it's just really important to
include that you know in your daily
practice um in podcasts like this are a
great way to do that thank you Nia
odia okay so I'm gonna wrap it up so I
the first thing I want to say is
um so I'll plug you know I'll plug
privacy counsel after what nio was
saying so it's really important for you
to know what's going on but it's really
important for you to have Council that
knows what is going on but is able to
interpret it and help you foresee what's
coming down the pike in order for you to
be able ble to have preventative
compliance um which ties in with what
God was saying like the checkbook the
Box thing is a disaster anyway but it's
really important that you get
sophisticated legal advice because the
unsophisticated legal advice of here are
15 laws that are going to go into effect
in 2024 like Chan gbt can tell you that
how does that what do you need to do now
which how do you prioritize what's a big
issue for you is really is important um
the other thing that I'm going to say is
because I'm a big fan of um stoic
philosophy and Ryan holiday I'm going to
have a courage theme for my takeaways
both for the company and for the
individuals so I think for companies I
think on the courage theme I think you
need to one um you need to have a strong
privacy Advocate like you need to have a
CPO or you know Chief privacy counsel
Etc um who is you know frankly like both
knows what they're doing but has a the a
strong personality in order to you know
be heard so the company you know
implements it um and you also need to
create a system of accountability in the
company right if it's not in the company
culture then you can have the best you
know CPO ever but they go to the CEO and
like no that's also not going to work
right the other piece which is also
courage and ties with what both G and
Nia were saying is I have in my notes
don't shy away from the mapping and the
clarity I have clients that just it's
like you know it's like my my daughter's
you know the corner in my daughter's
room that like is going to take four
hours to sort through because it's such
a mess right so you're like I can't
touch that unstructured data or oh I
can't touch the you know do not sell did
we separate all the sales and shares or
oh we can't like don't don't shy away
from that and don't kind of gloss it
over with kind of vague language in your
privacy notice because guess what The
Regulators are looking at your vague
privacy notice they understand it's a
patch and you have a mess on underneath
and you're going to get an enforcement
action so I think that's one that's
those are two for the companies and then
for people I think and people were
asking about you know careers I think
that generally speaking you should find
you know you should you know choose this
if it's chosen you right if it really
speaks to you and you're passionate
about it but um just generally in your
practice when you're practicing I would
say say you know be humble on the one
hand so like don't be driven by ego and
like what would people say but also be
courageous right like you it's really
important to me and I do this in my in
my work and it's you know I I want to do
the right thing and you should do the
right thing and the right thing and and
I'm not talking about you know zero risk
tolerance that's not there is companies
have to have some sort of risk but you
need you know what the right is so you
need to do the right thing and if the
the if you're outside counsel and the
client doesn't want to do the right
thing you need to tell them that they
need to do the right thing because
there's going to be consequences and if
you're inhouse counsel you also need to
make sure that they're doing the right
thing because and we said that one
because it's the right thing and the
right thing should be what we should all
aspire to but also if that doesn't speak
to you it's because you're G to get an
enforcement action with a 20year
timetable on it with the FTC and that's
really going to screw up up you're
differentiating right so do it for that
reason thank you and I love the touch of
sism for this talk I I'm not familiar
with this author I saw that you've been
I need to check it out right you've been
really yeah he's awesome yeah to check
it out uh from my side I'm going to go
so the one is similar to what Nia said a
little bit so about reading and being
and I think you pe privacy people cannot
avoid it anymore so that's one of the
reasons that I write the newsletters so
really you have to have a broad look
into what's going on and have so I I I
would say being off topic here I I think
privacy professionals should be very
organized and have systems so a system
maybe like AIA waking up 5: a.m. I'm
kidding so but but really the systems
think like you you need to find a way to
follow what follow what's going on you
can't avoid it maybe other careers when
you work with some type if you work with
some type of law or maybe Tech privacy
you can't avoid like following up what's
going on so news my newsletter is one
example there I newsletters are good or
other for example newsletters are a good
way
podcast yeah mentioned community so
being in touch with other privacy
professionals there there's this even
joke there privacy talk privacy people
get get together and they talk but it
helps because it's a lot of pressure and
I don't think you can avoid that there
is no way to be like good and up to date
if things are changing so fast so my off
topic uh suggestion would be system so
whatever suits you so waking up early or
having groups of privacy people
community or newsletter podcast whatever
suits your routine you you need to have
systems to help you digest everything
that is going on uh and also this idea
of interdisciplinarity so especially
from a Leo as a lawyer and someone who
went to law school we tend to see things
like in a box so employment law
copyright law and and and different
boxes of Law and you specialize in one
field and and privacy is really not that
it's it's getting more and more
interdisciplinary and we see that with
uh the design thing and and when when
you need to when if you're a lawyer you
need to know a bit about design and
interfaces and Tech and how you talk
about consent and okay it's consent
informed okay you know the gdpr but you
need to know consent management
platforms how are they implemented in
practice what can be the legal problem
when you're implementing Tech so it
involves uh it it requires a very
interdisciplinary brain so I think for
as the question was 2024 and also with
AI coming and and you need to be fluent
in and I I think it's like if even if
you are talking about privacy you need
to be to not not an engineer not a
machine learning developer but you need
to talk about AI with certain fluences
so I think you should people privacy
people privacy profession should try to
also uh look for interdisciplinary soci
training or resource that help you
understand and and talk about and and
when your client asks and if you're a
lawyer or if
you're a DPO if you have to to discuss
with internal stakeholders about privacy
and and privacy Tech you need to have
that vocabulary or or to to not speak
okay chat AI is okay chat GPT it's not
enough anymore I don't think it's an
excuse so you need to go a a little bit
deeper so I think it's a it's a good tip
for 2024 if you if you're not such a
techy person this is the year to be more
techy because it's getting deeper into
the technology so as we talk about
privacy by Design privacy embedded into
design so if you're a privacy person I
think you're going to uh be well if work
better if you know more about the tech
part so now we we finish the the the big
questions I want to conclude this very I
hope it was Dynamic for everyone but I
want to ask each one of the guests to uh
to do let's say let's go in the audious
spirit of stoicism you can you can
choose your own k you don't need to to
choose a philosophy but you can say like
a a final thing one a very short like
one sentence a final message to the
audience and well and please let people
know where they can find you if you're
more mostly on LinkedIn on YouTube on X
on Tik Tok or if you're not on social
you're a private person and they can
check your your company really short so
one sentence and how can they follow you
and learn more from you so let's start
who should I start I I don't I I lost so
I think odia I finish let's start with
odia this
time um one sentence takeaway
um uh I don't know I think maybe kind of
um get get serious about um about what
you are doing in privacy I don't know I
think I as as I said I am uh kind of not
just because of this but because of
everything that's going on in the world
right now I think that you know I just
read read I actually just read a Ryan
holiday quote and I can use that
basically it said something like each
person needs to do what they can to make
the world a better
place understand that the impact will be
infantes and take care of themselves to
as being a good human being and I think
that's a good takeaway because you want
to first of all it's really difficult in
the wake of what's going on and you know
Louisa and God know this better than
anybody to kind of care about cookie
compliance when like the world is
blowing up but you want to do what you
can to do something meaningful care
about what you're what you what you're
doing do the best you can and then
realize that you're part of a bigger
system and um for me the easiest I do
some on X but I do a lot on LinkedIn so
find me on
LinkedIn thank you
Nia yeah I think the biggest takeaway we
have is this is hard um but these
challenges are really what makes this
space so exciting right and you know so
jump in dive in and um let you know work
together to try to solve these you know
gnarly problems and if you'd like to
know more about how you can leverage
technology um to help your company
identify communicate and fix privacy
issues um in your app more effectively
and efficiently you can learn more about
my product checks on our website at
checks. goole.com
thank you ni and G love it uh so my
takeaway is uh
investing in the single source of data
truth within the company really
understanding what we're dealing with as
a company whether it's the systems or
the data I think this is the the true
pillar to unlock any other thing on top
of it so invest in that invest in
automation uh you can find me on
clubhouse no I'm kidding I don't know if
this is really exist anymore but I'm you
can find me on LinkedIn or Twitter or in
mos. this is our website right um thank
you thank you so my short take of topic
so invest in personal growth personal
growth will come after become before
personal professional growth so yeah
Health uh work life balance uh do things
that you love if you all help you be
inspired for your privacy
Journey um you can find me you know
where you can find okay everybody knows
okay LinkedIn X and YouTube and don't
forget to subscribe to the newsletter
Louis newsletter. comom to be notified
of the next Live Events and receive the
weekly emails about privacy techi and if
you want to dive deeper we have now a
four week boot camp on privacy Tech AI
the January uh cohort sold out so now we
have the February one so write to me if
you're interested get in touch with I I
can send the link and I'll tell you uh
how you can register thank you so much
for H everyone for joining and I'm so
happy to see the chat I forgot to say in
the beginning that H it's it's always
nice to have the the chat busy and I
didn't need to say anything and people
already started introducing themselves
and and being polite and sharing
resources so that's the Privacy
Community it's always like that and I I
see sometimes online on X other
communities fighting and and being not
not so so cool to each other but privacy
the Privacy Community is amazing it's
strong and is very helpful and nice with
each other so I'm I'm happy to see thank
you AIA Nia and G it was a pleasure to
have your here so I think the the the
the advices the resources and everything
that is said it's so important and it's
going so for those that did not watch
live it's it's recorded then I'm going
to upload on my YouTube channel and
podcast soon and maybe this week and
thank you so much I see you in the next
live talks bye-bye
