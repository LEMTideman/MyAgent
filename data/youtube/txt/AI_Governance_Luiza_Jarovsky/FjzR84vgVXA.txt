hi everyone welcome to another episode
of our AI governance live talk so today
I'm here with Andre guamu so welcome
Andre he is an associate professor of Ip
law at the University of Sussex he's
also the editorinchief of the Journal of
world intellectual property and he is an
internationally acclaimed IP uh
professional so welcome Andreas I'm so
happy to have you here thanks very much
for having me it's a both an honor and a
pleasure I'm big fan of your work my my
pleasure before we start so some
practical uh issues so if you want to
stay up to date with everything AI
governance also to stay up to date with
the next AI uh governance live talk so
subscribe to my newsletter uh wi
newsletter. comom also if you want to
join the next AI governance training so
the January uh sold out is already
started so you can join the February one
the link you can you can H visit our
website Ain privacy.com so you see under
my name and you can register for the
February cohort now let's get started so
we're discussing Ai and copyright
infringement so what what what is this
intersection what why is copyright
relevant when we talk about AI so let's
let's use as an example chat GPT so chat
GPT is an example of AI chatbot uh and
how is it trained so it's based on a AI
model and to train the AI model
companies usually so they want to train
large language models they will scrape
the internet and kind of digest
everything that is on the internet to
train that model and when you digest
everything so you also they're also
using uh copyrighted works so for
example books we'll talk about today
some songs and and other types of
sources to feed this AI model that will
power the AI chatbook so this is what
we're going to discuss today so um they
have been various lawsuits so if you're
paying attention to the news so you know
that in the US in the EU I saw also
Canada India other countries they have
been lawsuits and what are those
lawsuits basically are the Creator
sometimes is news media companies
sometimes uh music companies sometimes
book authors uh visual artists all sorts
of creators they are suing those AI
companies so compan developing AI models
and AI systems because they're saying
listen you use my copyrighted work to
train your AI model or your AI system
and I didn't consent I was not
compensated and sometimes they also say
so this the output is infringing so it's
competing with my own work so they are
suing for various legal uh reasons legal
arguments
and that's what we're discussing today
so what are those issues exactly so is
it copyright infringement what are the
the precise arguments is it only in the
training phase also in the output phase
uh also we going to talk about some
other issues such as can we if I use AI
to create an image or a literary work
can I copyright that work so these are
the issues we are discussing today so I
hope now everybody more or less
understands uh the topic so let's get
started with some us lawsuits so the
first one is New York Times versus open
AI so I I'll let Andress he knows
everything about this this lawsuit so
I'll let him talk a little bit about
especially focusing on on the main
arguments so what what are is each part
saying and maybe who is going to win
this lawsuit and what what the audience
can learn from this lawsuit um thanks
first of all if I knew who was going to
win the the lawsuit I would be picking
lottery numbers probably it's some of
these
uh are extremely extremely difficult to
to to discern so first of all I do want
to mention I'm not a US lawyer I I've
been studying the cases and following
some of them as you mentioned there are
38 cases right now we um ongoing uh
three of them are privacy cases so maybe
about 34 33 copyright ones um but
usually the the New York Times case is a
very good one to start because it sort
of has a little bit of everything that
we are looking for so what is happening
is that these companies as you mentioned
already ER are ingesting large amounts
of H works that are often protected by
copyright there are people that are
working on public domain Creative
Commons sort of Open Source stuff H so
the vast majority majority of the
commercial models are being trained on
works that are protected by copyright
and that means that there has to be an
ingestion of these works and for this to
happen there has to be a copy and this
is a always they're going to have a copy
in store in some place and then they're
going to extract some information some
mathematical information and then
they're going to train the
model there arguments of whether or not
copies are kept uh for the most part we
can assume that they're not but most of
the cases in particular the New York
Times case is um The New York Times are
arguing okay you went out and with
crawlers you crawled our website and you
have been crawling and copying our art
our articles that is copyright
infringement and
therefore um you have to pay us a
license and there were actually
negotiations beforeand H in which uh
Microsoft and openi were trying to
negotiate some formal fee uh some of the
companies have actually been paying some
Publishers um clu if I remember
correctly was one Springer was another
um I I I I may get I'm pretty much
Springer was one of them the ones that
had an agreement so there has already
been some agreements made so the
negotiations didn't go anywhere and New
York Times soon
the lawsuit was very interesting
um because
um um it was one of the first
actually it was the first case that I
know of that was able to present outputs
infringing as well so New York Times
argued not only did you copy our works
in the ingestion in the input phase uh
you
also um
made uh you're able or your chat GPT is
able to
reproduce and regurgitate almost it was
the word that was used um large chunks
of our articles and they had a large
number of examples of this happening so
this was a very very interesting case
because of of this reason it's still
ongoing
um the defendants are mostly arguing um
for use which we can go into that a bit
later but most interestingly as well um
there is an argument that from the
defendants that the technology itself
has non-infringing uses and that brings
us to um lovely cases from Far uh from
from from the past U the Sony uh
Universal case in which um the betamax
technology was capable of uh infringing
copyright and people were able to
copy videos in their in their homes and
that was considered to be a a technology
that even though it could be used for
infringing it also had non substantial
non
infringing I think
yeah no I was just saying that at this
point especially so that we organized
the thoughts for the audience so maybe
we could start with split in three parts
so we start with the the input phase so
the the training phase right so sorry
the input phase the training phase where
where the AI company is ingesting the
copyrighted work or New York Times
article to train the model so what could
be the pros and cons so what so the open
AI is saying that it's just a background
process right it's not really copying
I'm just it's just this AI system or
this AI model that ingesting this data
to to learn the patterns right they say
it's not real copy as copyright law is
it we are just the the the model is just
learning the patterns it's not real copy
and what New York Times says no this is
copy so what are your thoughts and and
regard especially regarding the fair use
part in this train yeah um so I there's
there is a copy um in in I don't know of
any system that is not trained using a
copy um you can split hers a little bit
you can make arguments that this is not
really a copy that it's much like a
human when a human reads I've I've seen
this argument use that is exactly the
same thing it's it's more because it's a
computer the computer you have to create
a
copy in the machine so if we start with
that assumption and we understand that
there's a copy we have to look at the
exceptions and limitations that
copyright is some exceptions and
limitations so in the case of use in the
United States um there are four tests uh
on uh on what is for use so the first
one is the purpose and character of the
use so thinks of whether or not um the
use is socially valuable or if it's
transformative so let's say you're an
artist and you create a collage you take
part of a picture and you you you have
transformed it and means potentially uh
but that's a potentially a different one
uh the second one is uh the the nature
of the copyrighted work so very creative
works are going to uh be less likely to
be um uh under for use so things like
information
data sometimes perhaps even news uh
factual stuff may have a it may be
easier to make an argument on for use
and the third one is the amount of the
substantiality of the portion that was
relate used in relation to the copyright
work this is going to be a tricky one I
think with the training
because are
we uh are we using the
substantiality in the final or in the
ingestion phase so if the entire article
was copied let's say in the case of the
New York Times and the final one is
potentially going to be very important
in some of this lwuit particularly in
some of the audio losses is the effect
of the use upon the potential market for
the value of the copyright work so if
what you are creating is have the
potential to compete heavily with the
work
um with the copyright work that is less
likely to be protected on their FES H so
those are the four as for what may
happen in this case
um your guess is as good as mine I've
read opinions uh from legal experts uh
on both
sides um I've been on record from the
start saying that you can flip a coin
perhaps in some of these cases
because an interesting statistics
perhaps that is is good to to give now
is that in average 60% of uh cases um
civil cases and all of these are civil
cases in the US
are settled out of court negotiated out
of court um and that means uh that
potentially some of these cases are are
inevitably going to be settled so I have
my bets uh on on on which cases may be
settled actually the New York Times has
always been very high on my list of uh
of potential cases that may be settled
but I don't know nobody knows whoever
tells you that they know what's going to
happen is is lying to you so
generally speaking I I I I don't know I
think that the New York Times has a
strong case I think it's probably one of
the strongest cases um just because they
were able to reproduce some some outputs
uh they were able to prove look you're
actually
regarding and just connecting the fair
use
uh
T understand because I think I jump to
we go back to the to Dow Jones and udio
and J but I want to to skip briefly to
entropic versus umg and other uh music
companies it was a recent agreement and
I posted about it and I discussed today
in the newsletter so I think I think
it's nice to discuss the fair use part
and and maybe uh how we can understand
uh especially one of the the fair use uh
test that we say okay it's not competing
so for those not aware so this is
another not lawsuit is still ongoing but
there was a recent uh there was a a
decision within the the lawsuit in which
so it's entropic versus universal music
group and other uh music companies and
they are say so those music companies
are saying that an Tropic in order to
train Cloe they scraped the the lyricss
of of the songs and and it's being
output so this is the the copyright
infringement and but but during this law
so there was an agreement uh so recent
now right the first there was January
2nd and where they agreed that and
Tropics so they have this guard rail so
they are they have implemented technical
guard rails to avoid copyright
infringements so while the user is T
typing the prompted it looks like he
doing input and output so everything is
not at a training phase so if we were
thinking about training phase so it's
not nothing at a training phase it's
during deployment so while people were
prompting CLA so they have implemented
some sort of guard rails we don't know
exactly what they are and how effective
they are but entropic has implemented
those guard rails and supposedly those
guard rails are good
and they can be implemented when the
user is prompting so those guard rail
they avoid infringement and what I said
that I wrote in the newsletter today is
that what my view and I know some people
disagree with me and I've read some of
the comments where people don't agree my
view is that entr Tropic was very smart
because the judge so because of this is
not the the end of the lawsuit but the
both sides agree that okay and TR these
guard rails they exist they are a legal
and a technical mechanism to avoid
copyright infringement and at this point
entr Tropic should keep them and avoid
copyright infom so now going back to
what you were talking about fair use so
if we end up and what is the Hope here
so everybody since the beginning I've
I've been just discussing uh AI
copyright lawsuits it's a big hope right
if if you have an AI company and you you
make sure that I don't know 99.99% of
the outputs will not be infringing or
100% there will never be an infringing
output the the fair use test would
probably be more favorable to the AI
companies they would they would have a
stronger case for it is just a
background process to train the machine
the machine will never output anything
infring infringing and it's never going
to compete with the original Creator and
it it's you know it's just the machine
which is seeing it no nobody else so
what are your thoughts both on this this
agreement between entropic and and music
companies and the potential is it going
to be a precedent so everybody's going
to okay so every com AI company now has
to have this guard rails so Implement
technical guard rails make sure that
they follow standard X Y and Z and
that's fine you you do whatever you want
doing the training field what are your
thought yeah I I I agree uh I agree with
you that I think that this is very
interesting is very interesting
development um we we are at the stage um
where we can expect little agreements
like this as I mentioned this is
potentially what is going to lead us to
some of these cases being settled out of
court because
and something
that companies and from both sides do
not want is a bad decision uh for their
side so when things start getting even
outside with jurry inside the room there
is potentially going to be quite a lot
of negotiation so this is a good
indication that potentially there can be
a bit of a give and take because as you
mentioned um if these processes are in
the background uh and all of the
potential infringing outputs are under
guard rails that would mean that um
there can be a negotiation potentially
eventually some form of Licensing
agreement as well and which I think is
potentially going going to be we can
talk about that a little bit later but
it when we're looking at how the end
game looks that could be guard rails a
combination of the licensing guard rails
Collective licensing agreements and also
of things but also application of some
exceptions and limitations under some
cases not every single case is going to
be F use for example in this case I
probably thought that it had a a
potential for fair use people can
disagree with
that at the moment as I mentioned this
is sort of a little bit of 5050 5050 um
for perhaps because it would be good to
explain some of the cases uh just
briefly so there are probably going to
be two main cases there are lots of
cases on fair use but the two main ones
that may come into play are Google
Books none of neither of these cases are
are related to AI uh so but Google book
is probably the closest and Google Books
was
a Google was doing large amount of
digitization of books and the argument
there was a fair use because it was all
in the background and there was no there
was a potential it was commercial Google
was definitely having commercial
operations here um but there was no uh
there was transformative it was
considered to be highly transformative
because the books were being digitized
but but also most importantly is that
there wasn't a feeling that it was going
to
um to impair the sale of books actually
there were some economic studies that if
your book showed up in Google Books it
was actually more likely
to to to be purchased so it's potential
that these cases are going to be like
that the second one is the more recent
one is which Andy warhole in which um
the one under World Foundation was sued
by a photographer M goon oh my God I
always uh forget the name um and um the
photographer one that
the antiw foundation claimed that this
was transformative use and the your
Supreme Court disagreed so it's very
interesting that we're going to see it
has narrowed down considerably what is
considered to be transformative use and
we will know we are starting to see
hints of warhold being applied in some
of the um early decisions so we haven't
had a a full decision in the us but we
are starting to see that the two cases
are probably going to be very very
important in this and before we continue
you want to explain your T-shirt oh yeah
yeah um so this is a um there's a sorry
I'm very colorful today um I mean tell
the audience where you're connecting
from today and yeah I'm I'm cor
connecting from the Guan Casta in Costa
Rica um so you may actually be hearing
this C is right in front of me I I
I didn't turn the camera because I
didn't want to be cruel to people who
are in Europe uh in the in the cold but
um most importantly this is not only a
fashion statement uh it's a very
interesting uh t-shirt or shirt because
U for those of you who have managed to
observe uh it's a Ultraman and Ultraman
is now famous in AI copyright because it
was the first copyright in case to be
decided in favor of
the of the clance so um
the um uh Japanese company sued uh uh
the makers of a image model in China for
corporate infringement because uh the
model was able to reproduce Ultraman and
so it is not only the first copyright
infringement case it's the first
copyright infringement output case which
is also very interesting we always
thought that it was probably going to be
inputs that that were going to be the
first case so yeah that's that's the
reason and uh some people may be
thinking that it's a a dubious um
fashion statement but hopefully that
explains a little bit more it's super
connects to our topic today so let's
continue with another lwuit the recent
one also so Dow Jones and New York Post
against perplexity so that we are we are
changing between AI companies we're not
always with open AI so what I what I
think it's interesting about this one so
they they similar argument so there is
the fair use uh so perplexity is arguing
fair use that Jones and new po are
talking that no it's no for you not for
use you're scraping our news articles to
train your uh AI model when you're a
system but what I think is interesting
from the claims here so two of they have
four claims so summarizing the claims is
input infringement during input
infringement during output but then they
talk about brand harm because of
hallucinations and I I thought that was
very interesting so part as one of the
claims in this this law so so Dow Jones
and New York Post they say that uh
sometimes like we know that AI system
they hallucinate for those in the
audience so hallucinating is when you're
Pro you're asking something let's let's
imagine what books did JK ring publish
and then comes Harry Potter and then
other invent titles that have to they
have to do with uh the topic of Harry
Potter but has nothing to do with what
JK rling has published so hallucination
means making things up so that this is
we we thought at the beginning of this
generative AI wave so November 2022 we
heard experts saying hallucinations are
going to be solved soon we will have
100% accurate AI systems and we are more
than two years in in this generative AI
wave and hallucinations haven't been
solved so there isn't one to my
knowledge there isn't any AI system that
that H developers say it's 100%
hallucinations free so it's and some I
saw also some tech executive saying that
is not a problem is actually a feature
it's part of how the the model works and
it the hallucinations will stay there
because they that's how models at least
at this point how the technology works
today so in this lawsuit they they say
so Dow Jones and newor post they say
that perplexity sometimes hallucinates
and while they hallucinate about the
topic whatever topic but then they
attribute the fake articles or the fake
information to their Media company so
this is a type of brand harm So within
this context of copyright I saw this
brenart which is extremely interesting
So within this copyright lawsuit they're
they're also saying not not only you
scrape our article and then you
attribute to us something that is our
article with fake information so you're
harming our we would not have published
that but then you publish something fake
you invent and then you you attribute it
to us so this is one part I want to hear
uh Andre's opinion and also I think
there is something really interesting
about this uh law also so now johnes the
New York P at some point in the L of
they say listen perplexity we even
contacted you we tried to have a
licensing deal with you we have
licensing deals with others and you
didn't even answer us so this maybe was
a bad choice and now we are here we want
our licensing deal and on the licensing
deals and Bri mention that I think it's
really it looks like for media companies
for newspapers who whose articles are
being scraped they want licensing those
I think that they have uh Financial
issues in their business model so they
are losing revenue from ads this new
business model with AI companies would
probably be very interesting so look I
don't think it's the same uh I don't
have the same opinion about creators
artists musici this is something else
but for news media companies it it it
looks like they want licens IND this and
in this Lo it's funny that they say like
you didn't want to talk with us about
licensing so we are here suing you I
want to your your thoughts and both so
the brain harm part so what do you think
maybe it's necessar copyright and the
license yeah I I do have to be clear I'm
I'm not a tur Mark lawyer but they're
they're bringing the dilution argument
which is our brand is being diluted so
first there is a false attribution of
origin um in that you're saying all of
the
madeup nonsense sometimes is being
attributed to us and that can be a harm
uh damage but also dilution which is a
very specific and and I'll let trademark
lawyers in the um in the audience I've
seen a couple and that I know are
already in the comments that are better
at trademarks than me but it could be an
interesting argument because already we
are seeing that the companies are
worried about some of the the
hallucinations having a detrimental
effect on people and you may have heard
that there there are some names that
chpt does not
uh you ask it about specific people and
it doesn't it freezes it gives you an N
message and that is mostly related to
defamation uh threats so there are
people who have been involved even not
directly on information but sometimes
indirectly there are two law professors
who who have been involved Matthew sag
and Jonathan c train whose
names you you can put them on chatut and
it doesn't work um so the companies are
worried about this because it could be
legal um issues for them and I think I
think that potentially the this is going
to end up with the licensing agreement
as you mentioned is very very strongly
implied in the in the lawsuit and it's
also very interesting case because
perplexity is a little bit of a of a of
an interesting example because it it's
not only an llm but it also has an index
um and if I remember correctly that was
called uh retrieval augmented generation
uh rag which is what makes sort of the
results more search engine like so you
get you are perplexed for something and
you get sort of the typical llm activity
uh but also very specific stuff that is
fine tuned from indexed information from
high quality sources and that could be
newspapers and all sorts of things and
this is where licensing would come in so
it's very interesting in that respect I
think it's going to be very unique case
in in that because what perplexity does
is very similar as well to what Google
is doing now with their searches if you
want to think about that and one of the
arguments in that case potentially that
will have also interesting repercussions
is that uh perplexity is stopping
traffic from incoming uh to companies um
which is also in the law but other than
those arguments I think that the
delusion argument is very interesting
I I don't have the expertise maybe
you'll have to have a conversation with
trademark lawyer because there are a
couple of other trademark related
aspects one of the Artest cases is going
to have some form of um trade dress uh
issues and the Getty Images case also
has a trademark element which is um some
models particularly stable diffusion was
able to to put the get the images logo
and sorry I'm doing this in the screen
um the get images logo when you asked uh
for something with get images which was
considered to be potentially harmful for
for them yeah and on the perplexity one
you mentioned um the aspect of indexing
that works like a bit like a search
engine because it attributes so I maybe
you by the way just a side comment so if
you you you see under under's name there
is written his blog is an excellent how
many for how many years you have the
blog 20 years um in October last year so
yeah 20 years is it I you cover
copyright or IP in general and mostly
copyright I used to do more software
patents and open source software before
but it's been mostly um Ai and uh
blockchain nft stuff which I always
found fascinating I I don't believe nfts
are the future by any means but legally
I found them fascinating so that's the
other topic I can talk for hours about
so people can subscribe or they can just
visit your they can just visit I am
question I'm what is known as a boomer
um blogger I I don't do
subscription okay so visit his blog
techn Yama is under his name under his
name so just going back to the to
perplexity case and the fact that it
it's also types of indexer so I in my
newsletter I see more and more sources
maybe you have in your blog too I I
check the analytics and I see more and
more perplexity so the source people
found me on they were searching for
something on perplexity and they found
my article so they they get to me so for
me this is and in the Los of Dow Jones
in New York Post they argue that
perplexity is bad because it's kind of
stealing their CL their subscribers just
because if you have the paid version of
perplexity you have more so it's kind of
stealing the so those it will be it will
be interesting to see the outcome for me
it's good I see I um okay the perplexity
is training their their system with with
my articles probably everybody else is
training but people are fine find also
my newsletter and coming subscribing to
my newsletter from P so it's interesting
to see how the judge will look at this
case yeah let's let's move to you want
to say something more about it can we
move to no I think we've covered the
yeah you'll have to bring in a trademark
lawyer for the second part yeah
fascinating I I think that they have a a
very a very interesting case I don't
know how strong it is but yeah it's
interesting the next last so we have for
those in the audience so don't for those
who are not as uh nerdy as us on they we
have two more more I want to talk about
with and two more lawsuits in the US and
we move to the EU so we have the udio
and sunu and then Jason Allen versus
copyright office two very interesting
law to discuss the main issues so this
now we we are switching we went to spoke
about the news media companies we are
moving to music companies so major
record labels to the biggest in the in
the world I think probably I don't know
the percentage but the very large
percentage of the music industry so
major record labels are suing uh the two
most popular AI uh creation AI Music
Creation company so udio andso so if you
haven't tried those that's how it's so
you prom basically you prompt it and the
system will create a song so let's say
you say I want a song about AI
regulation in the style of Taylor Swift
and and then you maybe have typed more
about how you want this lyrics it should
be about AI regulation it should site AB
andc will output both the song with with
the musical patterns and also the lyric
so uh and then major record labors are
suing them and saying listen you used
our songs so we have the copyright we
are the copyright owners of those songs
and you you use them to to train your AI
Music Creation systems and what is
interesting in this so first I want to
hear from Andreas if there is something
different so here we are not talking
about books and images we're talking
about music so maybe there are cases and
and the loss the copyright losses in the
music industry are very interesting
right so and and and sometimes I bring
this this discussion in my in my
training program and that that there is
a heed discussion so some people think
that that's the nature of music right so
even musicians they're all time getting
inspired if you're a musician you learn
how to play and you throughout your life
you're getting inspired by other artists
so when you create your own music is
going to be heavily inspired or inspired
by others there's no original 100%
original you know so some people are uh
kind of have this this view of music so
first from a strict legal perspective I
want to hear from Andress is there
something different uh from a legal
perspective when music is evolved um
strictly speaking no there is um
potentially what is going to happen is
the same thing that happens with text
you need large amount of content that in
the case of music is large amount of
music and in the case of sun and audio
they have been very forthcoming that
they have been copying tens of millions
of songs and copied them in again in the
background to extract information and
that is their
attempt doing the Google Books defense
it's all in the background we're
extracting information U it's highly
transformative and then people can
create their their songs um it's
interesting because
music copyright can be very interesting
in the sense that for the most
part U being very similar or being in
the same genre of another song is not
necessarily copyright infringement there
have been very interesting cases on this
Katy Perry Ed shiron getting
Su all the time um for for his music so
similarity necessarily does not mean um
infringement but you there is a line
that is crossed at some point but that
is on the outputs so the lawsuit is very
interesting that they were able to
produce very similar outputs but in the
complaint they the the Music Company say
these are not we don't claim that these
are infringing copyright because they
don't want to imply that very very
similar uh works
um potentially could be subject to
corative FR because they represent lots
of artists that get sued all the time so
the there is a very thin line on whether
not something is is infringing cooperate
music so that is the only difference but
when we're talking about the actual
training of of of thei um the legal
issues are going to be the same was
there copying yes is that copying the um
fair is that fair use in the US or does
it fall under any of the other
exceptions in other countries we don't
know so and in this lawsuit they the the
the plenti they say uh uh so we are no
sorry the the AUD and or the defendants
they say we are just using the patterns
the musical patterns so that that that's
the if you were technically so the
record labors are saying you are copying
our songs they didn't ask for didn't
license those songs you didn't comp
didn't you didn't pay us and you use it
to train your your uh AI system which is
for profit and you're you're monetizing
our song so we should be we should
authorize or receive the money or
license those songs and we we didn't do
that but then would you and Sun they say
we do not we're not copying we just
using the the the it's always the same
expression right the the the style the
pattern so we are just training is a
background process as as andrees was
saying and what is interesting and I was
talking about that with andrees in this
case here UD and so the As and was
saying so the the founders I think
is I forgot his name now so the founder
of sunu AI he was really open about that
so he wrote a blog post and he said
listen we are the new generation of
musical so some some people in the
audience might remember that so A few
decades already it was what Napster and
Kaza what was the the early 2000s was it
and remind me what year was it um the
Napster case was
2000 2000 yeah so if
maybe1 with the with the appeals back in
time when we were younger we if you
needed if you wanted to listen to a song
you bought a CD or even before you had
the cassette but let's start with the CD
uh so you you used to buy a CD to to
listen to a song and then came some some
companies some famous ones are Napster
and Kaza and you could just do
peer-to-peer sharing so some of you
might might know it you could burn the
CD at home you would buy the device so
you would you you open this program you
would find another user who had your
song you would kind of do peer to peer
sharing and you would uh have your CD
you you didn't need to buy any CD so I I
don't have the details about the loss
maybe you know more much more about than
me about this if you want to share more
but basically what happened a few years
later now we have Spotify so probably
most of you have some sort of streaming
uh app in your phone so when you're
you're walking you're doing something
you you listen it's perfectly legal so
Spotify is one example there are many
others so basically the B the the whole
industry changed so it started illegally
started strange started breaking the law
but then kinds of things settled down
and now we have a business model such as
Spotify so uh the founder of sun I think
it's the founder of sun I think it's
Sun's founder he's saying we are the
revolution we AI is changing everything
AI is changing how we work how we How We
Do Everything how we how we design how
we get more productive AI is also
changing the music industry we are this
this new Revolution we are you can use
our AI system to create whatever music
you want before you needed to learn
music to be a proper musician to create
excellent music now you don't need that
anymore you just use our AA system now
anyone if you even if you are a shower
singer you can with in with a few
prompts you can become a musician that's
the future and the record labels they're
just they envious us they want a share
of our pie they they they don't want us
to steal the the their income so that
that's the only reason they're not the
good guys they're not they're even
exploiting the artist so we are the good
guys we are democratizing music and the
same way that it happened many times in
the music industry we are here we are
this this new world of AI music so this
is I think is the only one of the losos
where the founders are are are
straightforward that's it we are the new
generation you guys are the the old guys
bad guys so don't try to sue us because
you're not doing good for anyone so what
what are your your thoughts on this one
yeah it's fascinating we were talking
just before um the recording started and
I I was absolutely fascinated by this
case because um if there is no if there
is an copyright industry that you don't
want to mess with is the music industry
and we've had years and years and years
of experience of this and I I kept
thinking there must be a Twist there
must be some surprise they must have a a
ace up their sleeve that they're going
to make an a a clever argument that they
know they actually haven't been using
any music from commercial producers that
they're getting all their music from
1920s that is sold in the public domain
I was expecting something because I was
really surprised that someone would
enter the space against the music
industry knowing that they were going to
get Su and yes they got Su obviously
that
was evident Unown in their defense they
didn't produce any ice of their sleeve
and they said well what we're doing is
fair use and I think looking at the test
for fair use this is probably one of the
weakest ones
um I wouldn't be surp I'm not a betting
man but I would not bet against the
music industry here but as you mentioned
it looks like what they're trying to do
is press SI is disrupt is disrupt the
market is to be in this space where
you're saying you are all dinosaurs and
we are going to jump over you uh in The
evolutionary change or or all sorts of
arguments that these people are making
because for them the argument is the
disruption is they are going to get rich
no matter what from all the The Venture
Capital money that they're getting
and um just is like throwing a a grenade
into I don't know I don't want to
say Ny things it is trying to disrup
they're trying to the idea is precisely
to disrup and I think that the of all of
the cases there are different strengths
in the defenses I honestly believe that
this is probably the weakest and I
wouldn't be surprised if uh If U if this
was one of the first ones that get the
deed because I think it's is the F use
argument is weaker but also the argument
from the copyright holders is much
strong um let's move to thank you uh and
and just before we move actually um and
in this one about
against Ando so they say UD and sunu
they keep saying that the output is
always a new song right we never they
say we never output copyrighted work so
our song the output is is a new song um
so yeah and it's interesting again to to
go back to the fair use test so can can
they keep these arguments okay you you
train it with the the and it's
interesting that they use they say two
things in the law so they say we use
publicly available song so I always
think it's interesting how companies a
companies they conflate public domain
with publicly available right so they
they creating this new legal concept
that I found it on Google or I found it
on the internet it is the same as public
domain so it's not one thing uh and they
always say we we are doing what everyone
else is doing so this is interesting so
one kind of one company after the other
so yeah we are doing you're doing so we
are all a group of people doing these
new things so maybe yeah yeah just to
compliment that it's also important to
think with all those lawsuits with
something that we haven't mentioned
these companies are not only competing
with the uh copyright holders that are
suing them they're also competing
something among themselves
and it's interesting also to look who is
getting sued but also to look who is not
getting sued and because um we are
looking at all these 34 35 cases
um that are usually against the same
companies and for example Gro still
going U very interesting political
discussions here so yeah and all of
these companies are doing this same in
the background even even if they're not
releasing models themselves they're all
doing some training in the
back and let's talk about the last one
in the US which is a bit different and I
think many in the audien are going to be
interested so it's Jason Allen versus US
copyright office so what happened here
is that this this Jason Allen he's an
artist and he says that he's an uses AI
to create his art so he created this
image called the spal so this theater of
spatial Opera and he wanted to receive
copyright protection so he went to the
US copyright office so he said I want to
receive copyright protection and the US
copyright office answered that his AI
work lacked uh human authorship so he
could not receive copyright protection
and then he's now suing the US copyright
office he's saying I deserve copyright
protection and the interesting argument
here and it's really it's a really
interesting lawsuit here he he uses mid
journey to create his artworks and he
said that to create this specific one
this
the he prompted me Journey 624 times and
he says that not so it first it says if
you have used mid Journey it takes some
time so every time you prompt it's not
immediate it's not seconds sometimes one
minut have to wait until the output
comes so 624 prompts means a lot of
minutes waiting for the next outcome and
he says that he became kind of a
specialist he's he's like a pilot he be
he learned a technique to prompt me
journey to to make me Journey output
exactly what he wants so as if he Let's
do an analogy here so he's like a
painter with learning how to use the
brush so M journey is just the brush he
he became a specialist in M journey
promp and he has this special technique
that's why and he's trying to justify
his authorship so he that he should
receive uh so that he receives copyright
protection over his a AI work so General
so some a few questions for you so first
what do you think of that so is it is it
a number so first AI art can it ever be
receive copyright protection what is the
level of human authorship so
624 prompts is it enough 10 prompts
1,000 prompts is it about the number of
prompts is that any way to measure so
some people say yeah we have to verify
if you have to look at the final work
and see how
much is it even possible when we talk
about a right art um in AI
art um yes um this is going to be an
interesting one um because we are
starting to see fewer cases on the
authorship side the creative side of AI
not as many as the infringement cases
which is very interesting for me I
initially actually it used to be the
opposite um people were more interested
in the author in the copyright
authorship debate more than on the
infringement side at the start and then
all start all the law started flying and
the things changed um so the Json island
case is very interesting because H the
US has this um system of registration
and in their guidelines it says that a
work that has been generated by a
computer cannot be registered doesn't
have copyright and it's in the
guidelines so that's why um J got the um
he admitted that um this work by the way
it w an award in Colorado State Fair um
it it want on on the digital um art
category so oh you should he should just
keep getting Awards and forget about
copyright right so yeah exactly and I
think it's more of a
principle which is something that we are
starting to see with some of the
authorship cases um so he got the uh
application rejected then appealed to
internal Board of the U us copyright
office got that rejected and then
Su um shter the register of the
copyright the cas is ongoing um I don't
know uh to be honest if if we look at
the history of these cases potentially I
don't think that there is a very good
chance that he'll be successful he'll
have to prove that the amount of work ER
that he exercised was was quite a lot
and that the computer just was following
his instructions in his complaint he
says very much I use Photoshop I use the
gigapixel I use other tools and this is
what digital artists do all the time we
use Photoshop and it's been accepted
that photoshop is the same thing so that
has been his argument and the problem
that he has is that um there is already
a decision on this which is on Steven
tler um and the controller
of sorry and and promoter and um Steven
Tyler is super famous and in in AI IP
circles because he's um a scientist that
invented a machine daes that uh produced
two inv three inventions and applied for
patents all around the world and has
been
suing uh patent officers all around the
world to get his invention declared the
machine declared as an inventor he also
created a machine that created a
painting and the painting he tried to
get the machine declared as the artist
and he lost uh the the case was
dismissed and then um Su uh lost the
case and is now under appeal and there
was a a hearing and the hearing didn't
go very well so everyone is expecting
that he's going to lose that case so
because of that precedent uh it's
possible that Jason Al Allen is also
going to lose the case now this is going
to be
very ER jurisdictionally specific
because in China there have already been
a couple of cases where AI Works have
been granted copyright protection so you
mentioned it was like 6 and so minutes
by the way Jason people dispute that um
apparently there had contradictions this
argument so that may play so how do you
prove right so you take a screenshot you
you have to so is even there's also I
would say um a procedural issue here so
will the US copyright office then
evaluate 624 screenshots and yeah is I
don't know
also think that Jun is trying to kind of
make a statement he's trying the same
way that UD and sunu they want to kind
of say ah music has changed so Jon wants
to say art has changed so I'm the new
artist yeah this is more it's the same
with Steven tler lawsuits they are
trying to push the envelope they they're
more like lawsuits that are less about
the their own copyright because I don't
think that something that we have been
learning is that um particularly with
art is that is not very Val
so what's the point of having copyright
you know you you can just keep churning
out images or text so
um something that has been sort of
changing the narrative when it comes to
authorship or or or giving copyright to
these machines is that okay oh someone
is copying my work I'll Just Produce
10,000 more whatever it is um it it's
become almost like a matter Pride not to
try to get copyright and people like
Jason Allen or Steven Tyler are actually
trying to push the trying to change the
The Narrative again so we've had two
cases in China um outside of that uh not
a lot of case law and I think that the
argument and I'm probably going to be on
the losing side here because I was
someone maybe we should give copyright
to some works I I'm I'm happy to to say
that I'm probably uh going to be found
to be wrong on that one um I said oh
well maybe U but that was before AI slop
and all sorts of things started
happening so now I think that what has
happened is that a lot of the debate has
moved on and particularly the value that
people give to generated works is seen
as less what may be interesting is
potentially
um what may happen is that people may
start using morei in their creations and
not disclose it which is
uh tricky but you receive copyright
protection no and still receive
copyright protection yeah because my
argument before was a practical one is
we don't have a copyright police we
don't we're not going to have someone
just making
behind you at all times trying to see if
you use AI in writing a song or writing
lyrics or or an artwor so unless we
start
um uh it's going to become very
difficult particularly as these tools
are going to become more and more out
there more people are and potentially
already we are consuming media that has
been using Ai and we don't know so that
is potentially the only thing that I
think may change the debate but for for
now there is not a lot of stomach for
people to actually accept copyright of
AI generated wordss there
is I think that the debate is over for
the most part is not going to happen
most systems even the UK which had a a
historic provision on this section 93 of
the copyright des and patents act the
government is currently disc cing
potentially going to get rid of that so
we don't know
um but I I I repeat this potentially
what's going to happen is that people
just use it and they don't disclose it
which may be an interesting question uh
if we're going to value and not not if
right we value human creativity
more um what's going to happen is
potentially proof of humanity
certificates uh some form of a I don't
know legal requirement for you to
disclose whether or not you use thei
there have been hints of this already
particularly when it comes to detex so
yeah it's it's interesting I think that
um where we are now on the authorship
question has moved from two years ago
completely and I going back to Jason
Allen I think there's a very high
possibility that he will lose that case
and in terms of you were commenting now
on uh people using EI not disclosing it
I think so just before we talk about
Solutions we finish our talk with the
more positive side so where can we move
from this all litigation maybe
litigation is not so what could we do
but on this type this topic of AI art
and Human Art what I feel that is
already happening so now we have so many
to so we have uh you know grammarly chat
everybody checks all the text and you
know I post on link L you see the
comments and it's very clear when it's
AI generated mostly I see more on
LinkedIn I think on Twitter or
other people would would make fun but
it's a lot of posts and everything that
you you if you have ever use chop you
you look at it you know when when it's
AI generated and it's so boring what I
feel it's happening already just because
people are Abus everybody's writing with
this the same way before writing is a
way to express yourself both art and
writing and any type of expression used
to be a way to express ourselves with
our our specific talents our our maners
and our our style and now if people use
AI to create images AI to write text AI
to everything is standardized and
everybody's PS on LinkedIn they look the
same in other other places as well so I
think more and more this is kind of a
cultural reaction and and I see that
already happening slowly and probably
it's going to get more and more as AI
spreads we have going to have fall in
love again for everything that is raw
human with mistakes you know people will
start publishing articles full of
mistake on purpose you have to add
mistakes sometimes I I read my
newsletter twice and I I I I I start
being a bit perfectionist and I say but
then it will look like AI maybe I should
have left that I'm I'm Brazilian I'm not
a native so why do I want to write n so
maybe I should add mistakes I feel it's
become a bit boring so might might
become a this is from a cultural
perspect perspective I I feel that I
already feel it's so boring sometimes
that everybody uses the same AI tools to
write perfectly so where is the
diversity where is the beauty of
expression yeah um I I've been using it
to check my grammar mostly because like
you I'm not a native English speaker um
but it I was checking grammar on the
specific things but I just I never used
the output because it was it changed my
voice I have a very specif specific
voice I have I like how I write maybe
it's a bit quirky maybe not everybody
likes it but I have a specific quirky
sense of humor besides litigation that
we are seeing so how can we solve the
problem and what I mean by solving the
problem so how we can make sure that uh
creators artists anyone that produces
content can be compensated can have
their their autonomy respected or their
their if they don't want to have their
art or their books or whatever
copyrighted work to train AI they should
be respected so this would be solving
the problem and also if for those that
have already uh had their their
copyrighted Works to train AI perhaps
have some sort of
compensation I don't know going
backwards or or from now on and so some
some ideas so I I I sent to Andre so we
can talk about some of that so fair
training certifications licensing deals
Creator partnership so having some sort
of if you are a Creator and you want to
have your work used to train AI so so
you can kind of sign up for some sort of
platform uh I I have heard of solutions
aligned with output Revenue sharing so
if some sort of technical tools to say
that yes your work was used to produce
this output so you get some sort of a
small compensation for the
output uh Stronger opt out uh mechanism
so what are your thoughts on that so I
think that there is going to be a um
multifaceted um response um
I think that I've been thinking
very because I've been looking at
internet regulation and history of
Internet regulation it's that usually
big Technologies uh the internet
sharing Technologies a platform social
media come with a bunch of lawsuits and
then we start getting um we start
getting um legal Solutions so I think
it's po potentially going to be um um
number of solutions one is is possibly
going to be legislative so usually that
is the first well the first the first is
actually going to be the case law so
we're going to start seeing the cases
happening and my guess is that we're
going to get a 5050 split first um it's
going to take a few years for us to get
um eventually there so that is the the
first one cases then legislation to
respond to the cases
and then we're going to start seeing a
licensing deals particularly with
Collective societies with large
Collective bodies um we are we are
starting to see some of them flexing
their muscle GMA the German music um
collecting Society is already suing open
Ai and I think that they're trying to do
this for two reasons one is to sort of
to test the opt out regime in in Europe
but also to start testing what
potentially what um licensing Agreements
are going to look like I am less
um bullish or less positive about things
like output uh sharing or compensation
regimes because I think at least at the
moment with the technology that we have
right now it is almost impossible to
find out what were the um inputs or what
inputs were used in the creation of the
work and at Le in images it's not
possible I think potentially music may
be more possible but it is it is it is
very difficult to do something like that
so I think potentially organization from
the creators uh to get together because
it's going to be very important
Collective management but also
collective bargaining is going to be
very difficult for individual artists
individual creators to um to try to
negotiate individually I think that this
is something that we've learned from
history is that Collective
management and collective bargaining and
negotiation thingss to work better
so audience a little bit about what
licensing deals I think some people in
the audience might not know exactly what
are those licensing deals so if you I
can also clarify so for example when we
there have been already some LIC so one
example is Reddit I think redddit they
had they have a deal with both Google
and open AI I think with Google was $60
million speculated value so it's
basically a licensing deal you have a
company or a collective of artists or an
organization and they're going to set a
price so if you want to use our content
to train your model so let's imagine you
pay like I think what Reddit was $60
million a year so you pay us $60 million
a year and you're going to have the
right to use our when whatever is in our
platform you can ingest it and do your
AI training so this is that for those in
the audience this is the type of
Licensing deal so you you have this
contract that will set the terms but
basically you pay in the company the AI
company will pay to have access to some
sort of content to train the AI model or
the a
system yeah um another example is in
Academia academic publish publishing um
as you mentioned I'm a editor of a
journal of a l Journal uh our
our parent company Wy um already agreed
on disclosed amount of money uh to um
for AI training so uh a lot of our
academic articles are already being
being train on and questions did they
ask for consent of each each author what
there was some sort of
email oh you're opening you're opening
another C of worms um I academic
publishing is is is is another crazy
subject um um for the most part uh
whenever you publish with with an
academic Journal you are either giving
away your copyright or granting them
permission to do whatever they want okay
so no they they don't need to ask any of
the authors which is maybe they want it
to be extremely transparent Friday and
say hey authors maybe if you don't like
it anymore you could delete
but yeah but then our our jobs are tied
to to this so exactly but the licensing
I think it's an interesting aspect it
interests me a lot so the transparency
part so licensing deals for example
Reddit is is a good example so they have
this licensing deal with Google and I
think open AI too but then what happens
with the creators right and the people
that are there so Anders was talking
about the academic journals but the
other social media when social media
licenses the content so shouldn't the
people that are there the people when
you'll join a social media and with meta
it's interesting what they're doing
right so from it's a very interesting
intersection between data protection and
copyright and and and I would say
creators right and and and data
protection rights so you when you join a
social media your idea is not that
you're there to offer your content to
train AI you're supposedly join a social
media to share content to connect with
people and now what's happening at the
background is okay there are those
licensing deals which might be a
solution for the copyright
problem but then there are all sorts of
transparency issues and data protection
so what I I didn't sign up for that
right I'm blogging platform I'm blogging
here because I want to blog not because
I want to offer my content to train Ai
and then they would say yeah but this
your contact with me and then you have
to change your platform there are all
sorts of uh uh issues with changing
platforms the debate is very polarized
right we discuss this that that the
artists and authors they are angry that
they their copyrighted work they it took
so many years and so much effort to
produce and then suddenly comes an AI
company says hey I I want to digest
everything to train my model for profit
I'm not compensating to you I'm not
asking for your consent I'm just doing
that because I can and I'm I have a
enough money infinite money to litigate
if you you can litigate and they are
much deeper Pockets than whatever uh
Collective organizations right so the
the most powerful companies in the world
so rightfully so there it's a very
polarized debate and and many people
artists creators are angry
uh so first my first question is are you
optimistic is will there be any point in
time where PE both sides will be happy
are we going to find a solution and in a
nice parel here is what we spoke about
the music industry so I I would say
Spotify I I know that many artists they
are angry with Spotify they think that
the Spotify fee is too high right so and
other platforms fees are too high but I
would say we do not see litigation
anymore right it's kind of this it has
settled down I I I see art many artists
are angry but it has kind of settled
down so do you see something like that
happening one we will when and when are
we going to get to that point is it 2025
do you from what you've been observing
will it take five years 10 years how
long it will take to to settle that
yeah I think that things will settle
things will already settle nature aborts
uh chaos well at least legal nature ofor
chaos at some point we're going to find
a a plateau in which businesses can
develop and also creators and artist
feel that they are getting at least Fair
compensation you mentioned the Spotify
system I I still think that potentially
a collective licensing deals is going to
go to be where we are headed eventually
uh but yeah things will settle the
lawsuits will be either settled decided
or going all the way to the US Supreme
Court or the court of justice of the
European Union
or things are going to calm down at some
point and what is going to be left
after I have no idea if I knew I
wouldn't be talking to you I be a yach
out in the sea enjoy Margaritas um
you're almost almost you're enjoy yeah
I'm right I'm I'm right at the um at the
beach
now my my sense is that things will
equalize whether or not everyone will be
happy it's more difficult to tell
because as you mentioned uh tech
companies have all the power all the
lawyers um again I repeat not everyone
is getting sued so it's it is it would
be perfectly possible for most of the
companies that are getting sued at the
moment to disappear tomorrow and AI
would still continue because there will
always be someone to take
the take this slack um tech companies
are very much into this governments are
starting to very much into this um I saw
sorry I've been sort of ignoring the the
comments a little bit but I saw someone
mentioned the UK government just today
published a very bullish
AI U paper with 50 actions and one of
them is completely Pro uh TDM exceptions
H so there is governments are starting
to see ah this is a big selling point H
the US government we haven't even
discussed this the US government is now
a technocracy with Alon musk and uh Mark
Zuckerberg sucking up to Donald Trump so
the tech Giants are on the move and they
are acing more power there is that is
the reality in which we're I we haven't
even thought yeah what a trump
Administration a very Pro AI Tech
administr Trump Administration mean I we
I we haven't even begin thinking about
that so it is
very difficult to
see
how things would move but I want to to
finish in a in a positive note I'm very
positive optimistic person I think that
eventually things are going going to
happen that we have been seeing
talking uh and saying in the chat I used
to make lots of images on with
artificial intelligence I found it very
fun very interesting I don't do that as
much anymore sometimes I do is because
there is almost like a as we were
talking There is almost like a sense
that you're cheating that
you're
that I think that this slop is a is a
good description of this if if a lot of
AI is now being tarnished as slow and we
are going potentially to see AI in in
the AI industry to grow but again more
creators more artists uh more musicians
selling their reality their ress as you
were saying and potentially that is
going to be a The Way Forward
however that would depend on us the
media that we
consume the the choices that we make uh
individually and I don't think that that
is a copyright issue that is a society
issue in general if the politicians if
our politicians are moving Full Speed
Ahead with AI and what are we going to
do as users is there enough stomach for
a revolution of on on this topic but at
least I think that on the short term
term licensing deals is where we should
be headed at least for now people
getting compensation people people
getting an idea or at least a
recognition of their hard effort that
effort that they have put in the
creating their work and I think that
that's where Collective management
collective bargaining is going to come
in um I would like to finish with a more
positive note but I think at at least
for now this is where I think see things
setting as for the time frame and the
lawsuits are going to take years
particularly the US lawsuits and we're
talking sometimes if they go all the way
to appeal and Supreme Court and
particularly some of the more difficult
cases like
um the author guilt some of the cases
that we haven't even discussed gety um
authors killed those have the potential
to be 10year litigation you know and
some of the cases are we're starting to
see in Europe there is the lion case we
haven't even talked about
Europe yeah yeah yeah we haven't even
covered half of of the interesting
things happening H um some of these
lawsuits are potentially going to be
appealed all the way to the court of
justice of the European Union so oh it's
great time to be a copyright academic
I'm having the time of my life I can
tell you about it um I'm I'm a nerd so
so that's that's what I I I love writing
about this I love teaching about this I
I love thinking about this all the time
so this is a very positive way to finish
so where can people find you Anders

few yeah yeah um I've been getting one

question um and just recently one on the
a act and what the potential
implications for copyright may be and I
