hi everyone welcome to the 19th uh
session of our live talk today I'm here
with Ray son welcome Ray to the he
Louisa thank you so Ray for those who
don't know he is based in Australia
correct and is Sydney or meour that's
right Sydney Sydney uh and Ray is he's a
lawyer he's also a developer so he has
the best of both world so we we poor
lawyers we usually don't know how to Cod
so Ray has this magic power so he has
both sides of uh so the technical and
the legal side and he's also the creator
of the famous AI Global regulation
tracker so you can see under his name
here if you haven't checked yet so it's
an excellent tool and I've recommended
it in the newsletter so if you want to
stay up to date with regulation in other
countries so beyond the US in the EU you
should absolutely bookmark his
regulation tracker and also you have a
newsletter right R you want to invite
that's right yeah it's all it's all
Linked In the tracker it's all in there
the tracker so if you go to the tracker
you're going to also find his newsletter
also a great way uh before we start with
the specific topics I want to remind you
so if you want to stay up to date with
the next so first with the latest
developments in AI compliance policy and
regulation also subscribe to my
newsletter and if you want to join the
AI governance training so the November
cohort the 13th cohort of my four-week
training program so save your spot it
will start in the first week of November
so there are still places so you can
still uh register uh now let's get
started so first before we go to the
country so I added the flag so to to let
people know that you're talking about
other countries but before we start I
want to know about Ray's story so first
by the way I was checking your LinkedIn
Ray and I saw that you want is lawyers
under 30 in best tech lawyer under 30 in
Australia was last year right that's
right last year yes right
congratulations I'm proud to be here
with you so such an amazing achievement
so congratulations yeah and how did you
start so how the idea when and how what
was what's the story behind the global
AI regulation tracker how did you come
yeah well first of all hello everyone
and thank you so much for bringing me on
to your podcast show Louisa um you're
one of the most respected and widly
known voices on AI regulation a
governance so really happy and honored
to be on the same platform with you
right now yeah um so my story with
building this
tracker to start um I'll start with like
my story into AI because I think that
makes sense so
I've always been fascinated with robots
ever since I was a kid I love watching
shows like Astro Boy Robots the movie
THS the Tank Engine anything that's got
to do with machines robots and engines
and trains I really love that so
throughout my whole childhood I love
just anything to do with
automation I didn't know there was a
thing called AI back then I just thought
it was around robots until in high
school I started to you know I was at
the age where I could read and research
that's where the concept of AI came to
mind I was also at that time I was
really interested in watching Iron Man
where it was for me that was the most
inspirational form of AI having your own
personal assistant that can do pretty
much do anything for you and at the same
time was also into reading detective
stories um crime scenes and novels so
that's how I got interested in the idea
of Law and Justice and so I was dabbling
between both Le legal and Tech as my
sort of career choice eventually settled
with doing law as a career and doing
like coding as a as a hobby and I've
been I've started to learn code since
high school to build my own video games
and my own apps um it was really around
um uh uni when I started just to you
know learn how to build websites learn
how to build mobile apps I also started
to learn things around machine learning
just to really recreate my own version
of I man's Javis until um during Co
where it was lockdown I had a lot of
time at home to just do anything I
thought that's why I spent a lot of time
using AI to help solve some of my own
personal use cases my Mo my most
well-known use case was when I used AI
to analyze dancers so basically it analy
use I build a program that could analyze
a dance video and you upload your own
dance video to the program and it would
then compare the two videos to see how
how similar you dance to the original
dancer and I made a video on down on
YouTube it got pretty viral and then I
applied the AL algorithm to analyze
K-pop dances and it got viral throughout
Asia and that kind of kickstarted my
whole social media Journey on YouTube
just being the that guy who uses AI to
analyze K-pop so you can kind of see how
all these things are coming together
being a lawyer in my job um building AI
on the side and also starting my own
social media Hustle and it all came
together when um when I was researching
more on AI often topics of AI regulation
pop up in my search and we're talking
about 2019 2020 when the idea of a
regulation wasn't still very popular
that's around the time when the EU act
started to become to be drafted and so
that caught my interest and whenever I
read these materials I'll just think oh
I've got my own opinions to this and as
I got more opinions I started to write
them down in a notebook
and as my notebook expanded I realized
wow actually have a lot of content and
materials on on AI regulation and so I
started going on LinkedIn as well
posting some posts and some stories on a
regulation until I got to the point
where I've posted quite a lot of posts
of different countries and I wanted to
just colate them in one place and I just
thought why why not just create a
Tracker website that just tracks the
every country in the world and so I
started that Pro project um around last
year and I create this map and I just
try to make a simple like my own
personal diary you just click on a
country and just shows you a summary
over time I've expanded the functions
and features expanded the content and it
was really encouraging to see other
people find it useful and yeah that's
where it is today the club way
regulation tracker yeah excellent so the
first first region was the EU I imagine
the
first the main the main like the main
major economies EU us China Australia
yeah so there was not one one special
one that started basically it was many
yeah M at the same time that's right yes
and just thank you for sharing your your
story and I I always like to start with
something you know I think we we usually
we are successful with things that
connect with our personal stories so I I
always this is my personal belief that
we are going to shine in the world we
going to serve the community better if
we are connected to something deep
inside if it's something fake something
that is no just for the attention just
for the money usually doesn't last a lot
because that's not who you really are so
I love stories how we begin how we
connect with the topic that we love that
and like just on that like my the story
behind the tracker was pretty organic
but in turn the track has also inspired
A New Journey for me which is to really
study culture and history of as many
countries as possible when I'm tracking
laws it has prompted me to also dive
deep into that country's particular
history culture the way to do business
so it's also started some sort of
digital travel Journey for me so I like
it's a very positive a virtuous cycle
that I found from this experience and
before I go back to what I was like on
what Ray just said so when we we we had
this this call before our live talk and
I asked so Ray are you what what
countries would you like to talk about
and he told me any country ask me
anything the whole world I said really
the whole world is game you're you're
comfortable he said he he said he told
me exactly this so he's he's passionate
about world history and politics and
culture and how it connects just so just
a com it's absolutely true what he just
said but going back to the the the I say
the the stories each one's narrative and
how we begin and reconnect so you
mentioned that you you started with this
more I would say sci-fi right the the
movies and this uh machines and robots
and it's interesting just a side comment
so for me was the opp I was never
interested in those movies I always like
drama and and people and and and I don't
know Justice fairness that's why I went
to law school and what brought me to a I
was kind of a different path so I see I
I I always like the idea of fairness of
how people can be how we can help when
people are in unfair situations that
that's what took me to law school and
then a technology entered my my journey
when I saw wow technology can be
exciting amazing and it and I remember
when I had my first smartphone it was
wow it's a new world right you can see
there you have data everywhere you go
but then I started paying attention but
but it's not so easy there there are
there's the other side as well so other
ways that technology can manipulate
technology can oppress so then I saw
bias and then I saw uh part of my PhD
research was about dark patterns so
tricks that try to make people do things
that they don't want to and and other
ways in which we can see unfair the
unfairness that is is in the world can
also be I would say increased with
technology so my journey I I love to
hear your story so you came from I we
meet in the in the so we are hearing the
same life talk but we our origin stories
let's say started from different places
so just side call uh now let's go back
to to our topic and to the countries
that we said so we talk to to relate so
world countries and different countries
to EU and us which I think most people
are more familiar with but I want to
start talking about countries which I
think most in the audience are not aware
and not familiar so I want so I have the
the list so you all saw the flags in the
the registration uh do so I want to
start I I will follow the the the list
of flags so let's start with Australia
so the the place where Ray currently is
uh so there was recently that report
from Asia Asia Pacific area so and they
said I I was I'm not sincerely I don't
know much about Australia I've never
been to Australia so I I I learned a lot
with that recent report and Australia is
one of the most advanced right in this
context of AI governance and and
thinking forward about AI so it with you
R so what would you like to share so
what's going on in Australia and
especially in the context of Oceania so
how it compares to New Zealand and to
the other Pacific island how would you
explain the current state of air
governance and air regulation in
Australia yeah so I can definitely talk
about Australia um just to so that to
allow for smoother more efficient
conversation as would go through the
countries I might also talk about high
level themes that might be also be
applicable to other countries so that
it'll kind of make this conversation
concise so Australia for a broad
category of common law systems so as we
all know the world is pretty much large
divided into three broad legal systems
common law systems which legal systems
that have that partly rely on Judge
court cases to inform the to corate the
law you have the civil law system which
where rules are all codified into
legislation and then your Sharia law
systems which we see a lot in the Middle
East so Australia Falls within the
common la system along with the UK
Singapore India and likewise and so a
typical Trend with common law systems is
that because they have a very active not
active but the the court has a more
prominent role in the place the common
law or the judg made law plays a huge
role in how we regulate things so compar
to let's say the European Union where
the E act mostly has its fundamental
foundations in product liability and in
Europe product liability is basically
codified in full but in Australia
product liability is split across
various sources it's split across T law
where it deals with manufacturer
liability it's split into also Consumer
Protection Law and it's also split into
contract law so that's an example where
in a common law system like Australia
one concept can be everywhere and
imagine that for every area of law where
there's not just a statute you also have
to consider other sources so when it
comes to countries like Australia it's
quite complicated you can't just simply
say let's just have an AI law in place
there's actually a lot of structural
things to work through and right now how
Australia is set up is that there's
already a lot of existing laws like
Privacy Law Consumer Protection Law
Online safety law that broadly cover the
ground with AI and so what the
government has been doing over the past
few years is really just trying to work
out what is the gap in these laws and
how should we approach that Gap but in a
way that fits within the current legal
framework of Australia and so over the
past month the most recent update was
Australia proposing some mandatory guard
Riles around AI um particularly
high-risk AI as well as voluntary guard
RS around that and actually um the
government just released um all the
public submissions that were made in
respons the consultation and so they're
still trying to work out how they should
Implement those manary guardal into law
but in the meantime Australia has mostly
relied on ethic Frameworks and these
ethic Frameworks then inform both the
market practice in the private sector as
well as other various initiatives in the
in the public sector so there's actually
quite a lot of Frameworks and uh sort of
uh Assurance Frameworks in the public
sector at both federal and state level
so when we say AI regulation Australia
it's really we're really talking about
what is going to be the next step for
the private sector so that's kind of
like what Australia is in and it's a
pretty similar boat to um UK which is a
bit more advanced than Australia in that
sense and also similar to New Zealand
but Australia is a bit more progressed
than New Zealand so that's how I see it
yeah and in terms of do do you see this
effort towards updating existing laws so
amending or no or there are various
let's say Tor and civil law so enacting
new laws or amending existing laws
what's the movement amending yeah so
it's it's mostly amending the existing
laws right now Australia has the Privacy
Law reform going on there's also the
Online safety law reform going on um not
so much at the common law yet because
common law is changes in common laws
mostly in response to litigation and the
litigation seen in Australia is not as
active compared to the US so that's a
bit slow but there's been a lot of
activity Among The Regulators
particularly the Privacy regulator the
consumer and competition regulator our
bank sector regulator um Asic and AA um
they're doing a lot of whether it be
guidelines or whether it be releasing
statements on their positions there's a
lot of activity in that sense yeah thank
you very much R super interesting and I
I'm seeing that the the audience is also
following the discussion and let's let's
move now to to another country we have a
long list to go and this one is uh so
many people I'm sure are curious about
this one uh so China let's talk about
China and when we see the global debate
there is this AI race we'll talk more
about this comparison between China and
us so how race is in terms of innovation
or competition in the global Arena but
China is this mystery because I I would
say most people in the west don't speak
Chinese and we I would say the culture
is really split so there's this culture
divide as well so don't know so those
two areas of the world don't communicate
much in cultural terms I would say so
it's mostly people we don't know what's
going on in China we just imagine and
some people say look China is they are
advancing they are leading the airace so
we we need to and many people in the US
say that we need if we have too much
regulation if we over regulate so China
is just going to win the race and we are
going to be bad economically but by the
way in our list so in the whole all the
countries I we we are going to speak
about today China is the only one which
has according to I checked also a race
guy to to see those other count the only
one who has which has this this AI law
so specific AI law so how do you see
China R and especially I would say from
this point of V of point of view of uh
comp competition with the US so
regarding having in mind their AI law
yeah so China does already have existing
AI laws in place it's not it's it's
different from the EU a act where it's
not one law that regulates all a system
they're very targeted laws they they've
targeted three main areas being
recommendation algorithms so internet so
algorithms that feed content to your
feed ads to you they've regulated that
they've also regulated something called
Deep synthesis technology which is
basically their phrase for deep fake
generators or synthetic content
generation and have also regulated
generative AI specifically generative AI
systems that are provided to the public
now if you look at all these three
applications you can see a common theme
in them and that common theme is all
about regulating
misinformation so unlike compared to the
EU where the Ari regulation focuses more
around protecting human rights Chinese
regulation a is more around regulating
or reducing the risk of misinformation
that could potentially cause individual
harm or also social
instability the interesting thing about
China is again going back to I'm going
to keep repeating this but going back to
the legal system China is a civil law
system but the interesting thing about
China is that their approach to law is
it is meant to be iterative and
experimental so to give an example their
law on generative AI is known as the
interim administrative measures on
generative AI note the word interim not
many countries have this sort of concept
where we have an interim law so by
Design Chinese laws are meant to be
easily updated over time so they can
accommodate for changes so for and the
reason why they can do that because
Chinese law making system is very
efficient it's a it's a one party system
where um often legislative and
Regulatory uh agendas are driven by
Central economic policy agenda so if the
central government says AI is a key
priority for the economy make sure it's
safe then everyone down below Regulators
the the relevant lawmaking bodies they
all follow through that and it's all
part of the um kpi if they don't perform
well then that that that reflects badly
on them so right now um most of these AI
laws are enforced by China's Internet
safety regulator known as the cyber
space um agency um and their their their
roots are in Internet safety so you can
see the misinformation being related to
that Internet safety role the other key
thing about China is that along with the
US China has got a very large AI
industry they can actually manufacture
AI from start to end and so they've got
a pretty unique uh sort of proposition
where um they have they have a they have
a big they've got a lot of big Tech in
the in the country and so what might not
seem to be AI law is actually regulating
Ai and I'm talking about the competition
law and the data protection laws um the
big tech companies in China follow have
to follow these laws and how the
regulator enforces these laws will
affect big Tech and that would then
affect AI development in China so that's
kind of like understanding that context
can help you understand um sort of the
the various force that play yeah and two
two comments on what you said so first
you you mention in the same sentence so
efficient law making so for for as for
me as a Brazilian this is unique so when
we think of lawmaking legislative
process usually we think of something
slow that is always trying to catch
technolog technology space and you're
saying that this is maybe something I
have never heard of a country that's
super efficient in law making and and
enacting new laws so maybe that's you
telling me about yeah one other one
other factor for uh deficiency in
Chinese laws is that they all share
similar mechanisms and Concepts so
across those three existing AI laws they
all shed into an algorithm register they
all require some sort of pre-security uh
pre-employment Security check they all
have some element of content moderation
rules so if you those mechanisms are
consistent across the the the
regulations and I like to call this uh
regulation scalability where because
they got the model they can just
replicate that model for any given use
case that causes concern so it's a very
scalable regulatory model yeah
interesting and you also mentioned the
kpi so okay so we have this AI is good
for innovation is good for the economy
so let's do it so it's yeah sounds
efficient another comment on what you
said still in China so you mentioned
that the the the common topic is
misinformation then probably something
that we would to think with this me
Western mentality so what do you think
China we have this big debate right what
is information and misinformation so
this is controlled also by the it would
be a political decision in China right
it's not something established by laws
it's a political decision what will be
considered allow information what you
can say and what you cannot say those
would be decided by the government yeah
this partly overlaps with the current
censorship laws in China um I'm not an
expert in how the censorship laws work
but I can imagine all of the principles
and thinking in that would have been
carried over into the misinformation
regulation which includes the AI
regulation yeah I see interesting I
think from a western perspective it's
also different right so we we would deal
with it from I would say Free Speech or
in Europe so different constitutional
law so different also maybe this is also
something that slows down especially
when you're trying to contain deep fake
and then we say okay but if we block it
too much and then we are blocking too
much freedom of speech which is would be
something seeing us we cannot do that
and maybe that's
also uh next country we have is Egypt so
I I have almost nothing know no
knowledge about the how they are
regulating Ai and what's currently going
what I know which I learned in your
tracker is that they still do not have
on AI law something comprehensive in
this sense yeah um Egypt doesn't yet
have
and AI law in the same way as like the
EU or China have um they they they have
a ethics framework so they've got the um
the Egyptian Charter of responsible AI
which it's so this is the case for many
countries in the global South that don't
yet have ai regulation at this point in
time most of them have some sort of
either an Ethics framework or if not an
EIC framework some sort of economic
strategy or budget paper that emphasizes
the importance of AI in the economy so
Egypt falls into that bucket along with
many other um African nations and also
some parts of Southeast Asia so I kind
of see them as kind of part of the same
progress line
um one interesting thing about uh Egypt
is I might briefly talk about sh Sharia
law um which is kind of like what's it's
which basically a very prominent theme
thing in the Middle East so different
Middle East countries are have have
different levels of regard and um
Conformity to sh law but the thing about
sh law is that there is it's it's a
quite a sophisticated and complicated uh
sort of uh legal body of law because not
just it's not just about cified rules
and principles but it's also very strong
social religious and cultural undertones
within the law and that's very
interesting when you try to read AR
ethic Frameworks from the Middle Eastern
region you might see certain
similarities but also certain
discrepancies between Middle Eastern AI
ethics versus just let's say Western AI
ethics particularly let's say around um
automated decision making so for example
in shal law I this is based on my
readings um there's there's the whole
there's a whole new body of um uh
Finance law like Islamic Finance law
which has very which has certain rules
on how you can conduct loans conduct
borrowing conduct debt Etc and when we
about all the made decision making one
of the big use cases for that is finance
all Ming Finance all the Ming credit Etc
so when you see these sort of Frameworks
between West and Middle East around o
decision making Finance that's can you
see a lot of difference and seeing that
legal system the differences legal
system I'm coming at play so that's
that's probably one thing I wanted to
that I wanted to share that thought was
very interesting super interesting and
and from this maybe not only Egyptian
perspective but but perhaps other
countries in the global South so you
said they mostly rely on these ethics
Frameworks and and how how does it so
far right they still do not have
something of I would say hard law on the
topic uh from your perspective is it
working well so so let's think about be
beyond the the piece the the legislative
piece itself so from policy in terms of
policymaking and what's going on in AI
do you see the latest development
something that is working or they're
looking forward or they they are uh
expecting to have soon in law so they
feel they need to have something more
structured and more as this traditional
hard law on the topic yeah that's a very
good question um it's it's very hard to
assess um Effectiveness just purely
based on ethics
framework from just as an outsider
ethics framework is just kind of like
more of a milestone it's just a
benchmark to say okay you've now done
this stage what's going to be next for
you um ethics Frameworks become useful
in understanding how align is the world
on common principles so at this point in
time there's pretty much Universal
consensus on what a ethics should be you
know being transparent making sure you
respect privacy U making sure if a goes
wrong you're there someone accountable
for that so these rule these sort of
ideas are pretty much Universal they've
all been now codified in various United
Nation sort of documents so is really at
this point what's really the key thing
to see is how does each country
interpret that ethic and then how much
of that ethic
influences their their reg the activity
of their regulators and also the
priority or agenda of their law of their
lawmaking bodies so um so one example
which I already mentioned is like the
differences between Middle Eastern air
ethics versus Western Air ethics it
could also argue I say the same for
Asian a ethics particularly China
uh one of the common AI effects that we
talk about OC is AI security now in the
Western World security often tends to
mean like you know cyber security it's
like the actual physical um sanctity of
of of a data Mak sure it's safe but in
Chinese um the relevant term for
security is anrin but when you translate
it has two it has two potential meanings
security and safety now in Chinese
security and safety are under the one
term so they treat that together the
same but in the west AI security and AI
safety are completely different things
AI safety is basically making sure your
AI system doesn't cause harm or doesn't
hurt anybody and AI security is making
sure your AI is safe from attacks Etc so
two very separate bodies of thinking and
so that's why I find very interesting
that even though we have the same label
on ethic principle the actual
enforcement can be very different or the
actual interpretation can be very
different so yeah and just building up
on what you just said so and also in the
west we have more ramification so we
have also another level of polarization
so we have the AI safety people which
now in the US you mean people talking
about AGI or killer drones or build
using AI to build the next pathogen that
will cause the next p them so this is a
kind of massive events so this AI that
maybe we still do not have so when is
AGI coming and then there is in this so
this would be the AI safety people and
the other side of the harm or risk are
those people which I would say more
thinking about fundamental rights so
real world harms bias transparency
privacy which are things that we can
have examples now and and we so maybe
that you you were mentioning the this
this the terminology and the nuances in
China so maybe they don't I'm not sure
if they have also the but I see a lot in
the west there is this polarization so
some people they say I don't care about
AGI or safety or it might happen but
regulation should deal with what's
happening now and for example that's
what we see in the a a risk based
approach based also the EU Charter of
fundamental rights and then the safety
is something that might happen and
people do not know exactly when will
happen so I think it's nice to yeah
that's interesting because I recently um
visited China um Shanghai and Beijing
and soor not Shanghai I'm Beijing szen
and then just observing there I feel
like the AI hype in China is not as loud
or as crazy as we see in the west and
this is my this is my conjecture but I
think it's because Chinese people are a
bit more used to seeing AI in their
everyday life when you go to an airport
Train Station Shopping Center a lot of
things are like smart Tech a lot of
things already been automated for your
convenience which as a person from
Australia when I go I'm like wow this is
so Advanced but to them they've been
used they've used to that for like a
decade and so when because right now
this whole generative AI hype is really
starting from language models so from
Chinese perspective language model it's
impressive but it's not super crazy leap
and that probably informs a bit more
grounded and pragmatic perspective
towards AI whether it be around AGI or
AI regulation um that's just my theory I
could be wrong but that's just my
observation being on the ground
who visit China say listen westerners
they they must go to China and see by
themselves they think China is in maybe
in the past but China is in the future
so I I hear from many people coming back
from CH uh let's move on in our list so
the next one is India so such an
important country yeah no no uh
regulation so far and and from what I I
I was following last year the debate so
around is there going to be so it looks
like nothing in the perspective yeah
right
it depends on how you define nothing if
we're talking about just hard AI
specific law then yeah nothing but uh
India has India's sort of trajectory so
far has been very very
interesting past two years um their
government was pretty clear in saying
that we won't regulate AI we want to
make our AI Market catch up with the
other major Powers but since last year
they're sort of started on changing
their position to say okay we might need
to start taking some steps the
interesting thing about India is that um
even before all of this they have an IT
act the it act 2000 which has been
regulating the information technology
space to an extent but they also had
some lacking in Privacy Law so over the
past year they're working very hard to
bolster their Privacy Law regime and as
part of that they're also looking into
digital safety and as part of that they
also um plans to replace the it act with
something else I think is called the
digital India act so they've got these
other um anid laws going on to regulate
the tech sector broadly and so when AI
comes in it's similar it's sort of
similar to China where they're mostly
focused on AI for the purposes of
misinformation risk and that became very
prominent earlier this year due to the
election and this is a very common theme
across many countries this year 2024 is
like like the election year for so many
countries you can see the theme where an
election year there's a lot of focus on
deep fakes and misinformation and
threats to democracy you have that sort
of um theme going around and so India is
also part of that caught in that sort of
trend um since the election the sort of
the conversation around AR has slightly
quieted down but we still seen um
statements released from time to time
the key driver in India is really the
the Ministry the ministry of electronics
and it um they their their personnel
often go to events to talk about
incoming um a regulation it's been
reported that they're currently drafting
an a Rory framework but we still don't
really know what that looks like so I
think India is still a TBC
yeah um and and you mentioned that the
Deep fake regulation both in China India
now you see in the US so state law so
various state laws covering this so we
saw only in September I saw that
California enacted 17 new bills uh
related to various forms of generative
AI regulation but it's a intense uh
regulation in this sence at at least at
the state level in the US um moving to
Japan so recently last week we had this
uh I it was I I posted it and so many
people were happy to read so the the
documents from the AI safety Institute
in Japan so they released the document
on red teaming and people discovered
this institute and they were happy to
hear more and Etc so also maybe because
of the language barrier so so many
people in the west don't know what's
happening in Japan and according to your
tracker uh so there there is a proposal
but nothing no not finalized yet so is
there anything interesting uh happening
something that maybe we can relay to our
yeah when I talk about Japan I think
it's important to recognize both their
role in domestic and Global AI I'm
starting with domestic yeah they don't
have a hard AI law in place they've got
a lot of Frameworks they've got a lot of
guidelines they've got n EIC framework
so they've got a lot of these um
foundational documents set up and it's
been reported that the I think before
the election the the government was
working on drafting some AI regulation
but I'm not too sure where that's now
after the election that has just
happened but the general sensus is that
Japan's really going for pro business AI
regulation so they want to make sure
because when you read the actual news
statements and the government forums
they're really they're analyzing the US
and the EU Market very closely and they
want to make sure that Japanese AI
regulation is not as stringent as those
two so they want to maintain
competitiveness um Japan's also quite
unique because their Hardware robotics
industry is very well known similar to
South Korea um Japan's also got a very
vibrant content media industry like
anime fans might know so a lot of
probably one of the more active
Regulators is the copyright the
intellectual property space where they'
have played a key role in releasing
guidance and statements to clarify
whether you can or cannot use third
party content for training so that's all
domestic on the global side um Japan's
played a very key role in the G7 so the
G7 The Group of Seven covers like the
some the top sort of Rich nations in the
world uh Japan has really been leading
the whole Hiroshima process which is a
broad process for many other issues but
it has also included Ai and they've
produced a code of conduct that can be
adopted across the G7 Nations on how to
safely manage um high risk systems so
Japan's playing a very key leader role
in the G7 side so I think that's
something to to to make note of and
regarding Japan so I have we have
friends who have returned recently and
what I hear from people maybe it's not
the official government policy is that
the Japanese people they are or sectors
in the Japanese people they are
frustrated because Japan was such a
leader Tech leader 30 years ago and now
it's a bit as lower pace so they're
trying to catch up now so that will also
influence how they regulate AI so maybe
it's relates you see some sort of
connection with that that we have we we
at least I learned at school the the
Japanese methods so a few decades ago
and now we we don't hear so much from
Japan so the China is much more
accelerated their their Technology based
in Japan so do you see that influencing
how they think about regulation or no
yeah like I think part of the reason why
AI doesn't sound as big coming from
Japan compared to let's say China or
Korea it's because the software industry
in Japan is not as I guess prominent
compared to the software industry in
South Korea and China and lot of the AI
applications we're talking about are
really software based but when it comes
to Hardware that's where Japan does play
a really um leading role but that's when
I like to compare between South Korea
and Japan um because I feel like they
often seen as parallels with the very
Hardware focused robotics focused I
think the key thing about um South Korea
is that they can produce chips like that
that's one of the key advantages Japan
can but in terms of just the global
supply chain we're really talking about
Taiwan and South Korea and like you the
China and US building chips but the
semiconductor space that's where South
Korea has bit of an Edge over Japan and
so a lot of the AI conversation is sort
of rooted in that um also South South
Korea um if we're talking about which
country has had the first AI law if
we're talking like real it's not the EU
it's not China I think it's actually
South Korea with South Korea they've got
a law since 2008 regulating in
intelligent robots so they've got that
in place since 2008 which not many
people know of but they've had their
robotics industry very much set in place
and that's that sort of law is quite
broad to cover Ai and so they've got
that sort of Head Start start um
compared to Japan so but the thing is
that South Korea hasn't had much of a
prominent role in the global AI law
making space compared to Japan although
um South Korea the in the Online safety
regulator is working a lot with other
Online safety Regulators in the Deep
fake and Online safety space actually um
it was like last week where South Korea
no not last week end of September where
South Korea passed a law that basically
bans creation and even um just
consumption of deep fake pornography
which is quite early in this space right
now so that's interesting and and glad
that you mention uh robots we have this
from this Western uh perhaps naive naive
approach you think of robots Advanced
robots and entrepr robot you think of
Japan so I'm glad you mentioned and and
you mentioned also copyright so last
year I I probably saw this new so this
there is this national competition in
Japan right the best book and the winner
this woman she said publicly that 5% I
think it's 5% or 10% I five of her book
she wrote with CHP and that caught my
attention so she publicly said that so
probably other people are doing that but
she she said yes 5% of my book was
written by CH and there were no so she
still got the national literature PR in
Japan so just because you mentioned and
now that we have this discussions so can
if you if you use AI to produce your
work can it be protected by copyright
law so that I remember this story from
Japan um so now let's move on let's
let's take a plane to the other side of
the world and let's about Mexico so I'm
also um unaware of recent developments
so we don't hear much about Mexican
developments in AI is there something
interesting something memorable about
Mexico yeah not just Mexico but just
South America in general like I feel
like South America is a bit under
reported in the AI governance and
regulation space so um
Mexico I what what we know so far from
news is that they are currently having a
draft law in place law for ethical
regulation of AI since um 2013 but not
too sure where has that landed so I'm
still on the outlook for that but I
think just to go broader I feel like
South America is such a fascinating Mark
of to study because I think this is kind
of preempting the your your next
question on Brussels effect and the EA
act out of all the continents in the
world the South American Market is a lot
of them are adopting similar styles to
the eui ACT but when you compare Brazil
to Chile to Mexico to Argentina's sort
of own respective drafting of the AI
bill they got very different variations
and very different interpretations of
the E act and that makes me that makes
me think a lot about how influential is
the EA act actually many people compare
the EA act as the next gdpr the gdpr
when it came through it was so good that
everyone basically adopted if you don't
adopt you're basically behind or you're
going to cause yourself
hassle I'm actually see so that's where
sort of the Brussels effect term really
became prominent but when I actually
look at the E Law and see how other cons
reacted to it including how Japan has
reacted to it how South America reacted
to it many countries are they they like
the idea of a risk-based framework so
the EA act higher prohibit risk higher
risk lot of countries like that idea but
the actual Drafting and the format of
the law is not that popular compared to
what many people think and so when I
read the South American bills a lot of
them adopting the risk-based framework
but they're not they're rejecting a law
of the the very strict mechanisms and
drafting of the E Law and this is not
just coming from me this is also coming
from Argentina's president uh who uh
months ago said that they are looking
they want to make Argentina like a
global hub for AI investment in business
especially in the region and they're
openly going to get for Less stringent
rules compared to the EU and so I find
that as a pretty tangible sort of case
study to show that the EA ice might not
be as consequential as many people make
it out to be but I could be very wrong
who knows yeah know it's yeah you you're
we are going to discuss that and I'm
glad that you brought this topic now and
I've been reading some uh papers
recently about people who say no they
brought us the fact it happened with the
gdpr so theidea many of the Core
Concepts of the gdpr so consent or uh
the principles in lat subjects rights
they were reflected in other laws so we
so we we we thought that wow Europe is
really exporting regulations so they
maybe they don't export so many
advancements in technology but they
export definitely export regulatory
approaches so we had that with the gdpr
for those in the audience that are not
from the legal field so gdpr stands for
General data protection regulations so
it's the EU uh data protection
regulation which was highly influential
so it was approved in 2016 and so far we
still see the Brussels effect happening
and recent uh enforcement you mention
Latin America so for example Brazil so
kind of following the EU trying to push
companies such as mea to be more strict
with data protection compliance also in
the AI context so a little bit of what
uh way was saying uh but it's nice to
hear that you and when we think when you
compare privacy and data protection with
AI so one one thing is to regulate
privacy so we have this kind of new or
Western approach of privacy as a
fundamental rights or data protection as
part of this new wave of digital rights
or something that is important it should
have I would say priority but AI there
is so the Privacy is not a technology so
it's I would say it's a way to see data
as something of a fundamental right and
when we think about AI here it's
different we are regulating Tech and
there is money involved and there is
this Global race towards uh being the AI
leader so those are two very different
topics regulating data protection and
regulating AI so I it's interesting and
I've been reading other experts saying
the same thing so no don't be so excited
it's there's no not such an incentive to
regulate AI so what's the incentive to
to win a med for being the the the
champion of fundamental rights not so
maybe Europe is interested in that but
not so many countries so there are other
priorities so you mentioning the
Argentinian president so super liberal
my guess is that he will be more a
hands-off approach to regulation so I'm
glad that he brought it so now that
we're bringing the topic so Brussels
effect a act do you think let's do this
parenthesis here so you don't think
what's your overall opinion so are we
going to see a Brussels effect or not
going to see in your opinion
uh I think it depends if the EA act
changes I think there's a lot of okay
right now right now it's a bit also
early to say because there still going
to be a lot of guidances and materials
being released to help supplement
interpretation of the EA act a lot of
these comments are already being made
because some of the drafting Act is a
bit unclear one example is the whole
thing around um general purpose AI
models and when you find tune so let's
say you're you're using a third party
general purpose AI model and you fine
tuned it then under the EA act you could
be considered a provider to the extent
of the fine tuning but the a act doesn't
really specify what's the threshold of
fine tuning to trigger those provide
obligations so that's one example of a
pretty big ambiguity that's that's
really affecting practitioners
especially also the whole extra
territorial application how it's unlike
the gdpr which is focused on Whose data
you're processing and where your
business is based the eua ACT is focused
on where the output of the AI system is
used in the EU which is a completely
different spin now that there's a whole
lot of concern around what if let's say
I'm building AI in Australia and somehow
my output gets used in Europe would I be
caught under the E act the recitals do
mention around in intention so whether
you intend the output abuse in EU EU but
that's not actually in the actual hard
operative provision so that's another
ambiguity that has really affected um
the perspective of the EA act but I'm
sure these things will be eye and out
and so who knows maybe it'll actually be
very good and efficient that it might
revive a Brussels effect so I'm I'm I'm
always open to possibility my my
optimistic opinion here so we have the
AI office which seems to be led by
ambitious people and idealistic and
people that are working hard to make it
work so there are standards also so
standards will be a good mechanism right
to keep the law so aligned with so we
were you were mentioning the topic about
the general a model so the AI off is
overseeing it and maybe the the
standards that are being prepared now
they will cover also they will help kind
of um the understanding so that it
matches the reality and that's so that
there is some sort of fairness in the
the distribution of the obligation in
the value chain so I'm optimistic in
this sense so let's continue with our
list so we have here now we we are
traveling back again to the right of the
the globe so we have Nigeria so Africa's
mostos Country H and by the way regard
I've been writing the newsletter so we
know that the EU is always uh going
after meta and and there is always some
European data protection authority um
pressuring meta not to use EU data to
train Ai and now we saw and then we saw
Brazil doing the same so there was this
recent decision and then we I saw
recently Nigeria also take the first
time I saw an African country also being
tough with meta and say hey calm down so
not specifically regarding AI but I'm
seeing some um I'll say regulatory
proactivity here in Nigeria so is there
anything interesting that the audience
should know about yeah so the the whole
African continent is also very uh
complex um there's been so I'll talk
about the broader region first so
there's the African Union so many people
might not know of it but there is the
African Union which like a loose
Association of all the African States
and they're working together to produce
ethic Frameworks and a blueprint so
again we're talking about ethic
Frameworks here in the case of um
Nigeria so
this is sort of going into a bit of a
dark history here but the colonial past
really shapes a particular legal system
of each African nation and so we we're
seeing differences between British
influence systems versus French
influence versus Dutch influence systems
and out of all these potential
influences it's the British influenced
sort of African states that tend to be a
bit more progressed in their a
regulation development with talking
about um South Africa and like Nigeria
so it's also partly related to the
economic um significant or the economic
contribution of the Afric of a
particular African state in the broader
region so again Nigeria doesn't yet have
an AI law they've got at least an a
national AI strategy and various sort of
ministers and Regulators have come out
just to talk about the importance of AI
really broadly in Africa there's a lot
more emphasis on just using AI to really
uh improve infrastructure and improve
living standards so this is often where
we hear the term leap frogging um for
example leap frogging from 3G to 5G
instead of going through 4G internet a
similar sense of Africa um especially if
to think about the connection between
China and Africa through the one belt
and one road initiative China is doing a
lot of investment in Africa Building
Bridges building rails so I wouldn't be
surprised if African nations eventually
adopt Chinese style AI law laws for that
alignment uh for that trade consistency
so that's what I'm sort of expecting um
if I have to talk about one one standout
nation in Africa it will be
Rwanda um they they ever since they've
sort of um sort of cleaned up their own
political structure they're very
Progressive often people say Rwanda is
like the Singapore of Africa and so
they've adopted very Progressive
economic policies and in fact Rwanda and
Singapore have collabed collaborated a
lot together recently they produced A
playbook on AI for small Nations so
there's a lot there's a growing trend of
like the the small Nations really
working together to do things yeah
excellent it's a great time to
transition to Singapore so we recently
saw uh they released last I think it was
no earlier this year the model AI
governance framework many people were
interested in it so saw this we already
hear a lot about from Singapore that
they are Advanced they are trying to be
leaders in in the region and in the
world as well and but I I always po
every Sunday I post AI governance uh job
openings and there's always something
from Singapore surprising look really uh
Forward Thinking in the context of
governance so we need to govern AI so
you you seem to know a lot about
Singapore and so many bridges with other
countries so H how can could how do you
see the leadership that Singapore is
trying to uh build here and and and how
it might influence the world from that
area of the world yeah if I were to
describe Singapore in one word it would
be pragmatic a lot of their initiatives
are just very practical and pragmatic so
normally when a country regulates AI
they go through this chronology economic
strategy ethics framework consultation
Draft rules legisl like it's like the
chronology and at the very end once you
have all the regulation in place that's
when you provide Market guidance
business guidance to help people
understand the law
but single has kind of skipped a lot of
it and just gone straight to business
guidance and business support they're
one of the first Nations to have like
government endorsed um toolkits like
actual software tool kits like a open-
source library that you can download and
use to assess your language model for
like hallucination risk so they got a
lot of initiatives like this they also a
champion of
sandboxes um partly because a lot of big
tech companies have their operations
headquartered in Singapore so their
location their industry really helps
with that but it's an example of how
single's going for really practical
underground initiatives which has
inspired a lot of similar ideas in Dubai
and also in the US the US the they
recently launched the like the de Patra
software tool kit which resembles a lot
to the Singaporean AI verify toolkit so
yeah Singapore but in terms of like the
the legal system very similar to the UK
very similar to Australia no AI specific
law yet but The Regulators are very
active and very um Progressive in how
they provide guidance so that's a unique
thing about Singapore and you would say
with with this business focus so it's
nice that to mention Dubai because now
we can transition to the United Arab
Emirates so this you mention this
pragmatism and perhaps this wanting to
be the the business Hub then you need to
perhaps that's the best approach being
pragmatic and and uh yeah
helping business to flow let's say
focusing more on the business side
so probably that's what we hear from the
UAE as well yeah UAE yeah I I'd say
pretty similar to Singapore um in terms
of strategy the thing about UAE is that
they they are very active in bilateral
deals they're do making a lot of deals
with other countries there is some
tension between how UAE um sing more in
the US compared to China and so you have
that sort of um politics going on which
I won't talk about too much but uh u in
terms of their documentation they got a
lot of guidance as well lot of uh uh uh
Frameworks guides they're also quite
focused on finance the finance sector is
also quite Progressive in how they
approach AI so um that that's how I see
the
waye thank you very much Ray so let's
our last country of our list so don't
don't go yet thank you for the audience
for saying don't say we still have a few
point we have tur turkey and then two
more questions so please stay a few more
minutes don't go yet uh so we have
turkey what what's what's to know about
AI
governance in Turkey our last country
today like out of all the countries that
I'm really interested in following
turkey is really up there in my list and
it it's for a few reasons right turkey
is like the mix of three completely
different worlds it's located in West
Asia so it's got that Asian side its
political system at least in terms of
its modern legal system is derived from
the European Western model but it's
demographic and culture is predominantly
Muslim uh majority so it's it's got It's
the intersection of three different um
uh I guess aspects and so when I look at
the whenever whatever AI approach that
turkey takes is for me it's like an
indicator of what is the more dominant
force in the world right now um the
turkey does have a draft AI law which
very much resembles the EU AI act and so
in that sense okay that might be another
indicator of the Brussels effect where
the European approach is affect is is
inspiring other nations apart from that
um uh the turkey has also got mostly the
the the the bare minimum for for and for
a regulation they've got a strategy
they've got some ethics framework and
then now got to draft AI law so I'm Keen
to see whether that law will will pass
yes or no um who knows but um
yeah okay thank you very much R and but
now I want to to switch back to you to
your personal view are you personally
optimistic about yeah in especially in
the context of this uh there is the
Spectrum right in the the open debate
about yeah so optimistic people who are
thinking about uh self-driving cars and
and drones helping that do not kill but
drones that help us but and other tools
that might make Our Lives more
productive more efficient we'll have
more time for ourselves and so on and
other people and and okay there and in
the pessimistic side there are two types
of people also once focused on AI safety
AGI we it's going to destroy all of us
that's why we need to regulate so AGI is
coming it's bad it's going to if we
don't act now H it's going to destroy
the world and other people who who are
also pessimistic but they think it's
already bad now so we have this it's
destroying the internet the internet is
being polluted with synthetic content
and misinformation and uh bias so
everything that is being output by the
system is somehow biased and we are
losing control because all the cont no
there is no moderation no human
moderation no human oversight no
transparency and soon you lose control
in that aspect so we kind of have this
unfair uh outcome which is already
happening so how do you see yourself in
in this uh polarized debate if you're
optimistic pessimistic and if you use it
and how yourself in this
context um
I might get pretty philosophical with
this now but I'm both I'm both and my
central view is that AI regulation will
become boring eventually but that's both
a good thing and also a bad thing a good
thing in the sense that it's sort of
similar to how we approach the Internet
safety similar to how we approach
batteries when these Technologies first
came out I'm sure there was similar
convers ation how should we regulate
that there were conversations like this
like this podcast talking about that
until we got to the point where okay
we're pretty much consistent how we're
going to do this and then right now
today unless you're in the battery
regulation space not many people talk
about battery regulation battery
standards but it's a good thing because
we now got a settled body of thinking
principles so that could be what the
fate of AR regulation might be it it
might take a decade or might take five
years or so but there will be a point
where okay let's now move on to the next
sort of
layer um that's where I kind of go into
the the sort of realist or maybe
slightly negative bit which
is unlike other Technologies AI being
general purpose it can be embedded into
so many applications so what I'm what
I'm a bit fearful is that especially for
countries like the EU or turkey or Japan
which are focused on AI specific law the
amount of time taken to perfect that law
it might become out of date by the time
like out of date in terms of how the
market has moved it's the whole it's the
very it's the very typical you know law
is always behind technology sort of
argument so I feel that there's that
there's that challenge which is why the
Chinese model does seem to have be the
middle ground because it is AI specific
law but they're designed to be changed
very quickly to adapt what's overcome in
the
market also I feel like AI like it might
sound weird coming from me being the guy
who likes to look at AI laws but I'm not
focused purely on AI laws I also have to
look at the big picture how AI interacts
with the metaverse the blockchain
cryptocurrency like all these other
emerging Technologies at some point
these will all converge in some big way
it might be that will be a whole new
metaverse economy and that's going to be
a whole mind-blowing thing and from that
point the whole idea of air regulation
might become mot because we have to now
worry about how do we regulate or
conduct ourselves in the metaverse and
AI is only really a small part of that
new reality I don't know if I'm making
myself clear it's a bit abstract to talk
about but in in in short um I'm
optimistic on AI becoming standardized
in terms of regulations but I'm also a
bit uncertain as to what is the
relevance of that in the next few years
once every other technology now comes
together to create a new to create a new
world and how do we na navigate through
that new world I think that's a much
bigger question yeah I think you're
you're actually pretty optimistic from
hearing you always ask this question to
all my guests so your answer is pretty
optimistic and and I like that you're
also optimistic about nft no you didn't
say nft you said metaverse and crypto
maybe n all those Hypes you think they
going to come back they didn't die they
haven't died yet so they will come back
and kind of this regulatory space so
interesting that it's very uh
interesting approach I haven't heard
framed this way and our last uh question
so my last questions so what first your
your last message to the audience of
something that you want to leave the
audience with also where can they find
you and very important so besides your
you there I hope everybody has booked uh
has bookmarked his AI regulation tracker
so you let let me you let me post here
the link so that everybody can check it
and and uh bookmark now I'm adding it to
the chat uh so everybody can bookmark
and and check later so you have Al there
you will also find his newsletter so
what else people can first your message
and where can people find you so besides
your your newsletter and the
tracker I think message
is have an open mind and respect
differences whether it be differences in
culture the way of doing things and
differences in politics I think this not
just AI but just just broadly there's a
lot of tension going around the world a
lot of
misunderstandings I feel like as we're
getting more connected now through
social media and AI I think it's a good
opportunity to really grow in terms of
mindset and be more open-minded and as I
said at the early beginning like this
whole exercise of cating AOS together
has also made me has also transformed me
in really respecting different things
and just learning I love to eventually
learn like more languages to really
understand uh the nuances in culture and
so I'm still on that Journey but if if
everyone of us in the world can take
that extra step I'm sure you know it
will be much better place sounds very
very optimistic but yeah I'm just hoping
that hopefully people here will um I
guess resonate with that and yeah my
website is there or has all my
information you can also find me a
LinkedIn where I do a l of posts and
yeah that's it thank you very much for
it was a pleasure to have you I think it
was such an interesting session so much
new information here I think for me for
the audience I've learned a lot here in
our conversation today two reminder so
