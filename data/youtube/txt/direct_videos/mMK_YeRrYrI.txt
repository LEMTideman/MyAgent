we really have to start thinking very
hard about what the impact of the data
driven version of AI is and how we can
become a part of it we should be talking
about digital literacies in terms of how
people engage with this technology and
everybody is impacted even those that
don't exist as data points because they
don't exist as data points you don't
want to have millions of cold cases you
don't want people to die you don't want
people to sit with serious mental health
issues it's not just about robots
killing people it's a lot more subtle
than that but a lot more dangerous at
the same time and it's happening it's
here it's the biggest threat to Safety
and Security globally and it should be
taken very very very
seriously welcome to the regulating AI
podcast join host Sanjay pury as he
explores the dynamic and developing
world of artificial intelligence
governance each episode features deep
Dives with global leaders at the
Forefront of regulating AI responsibly
tackling the challenges using AI can
bring about headon and enabling balance
without hindering
Innovation welcome to regulating AI the
podcast that brings Global diverse
voices together to discuss fair and
responsible AI regulation worldwide I'm
your host Sanjay Puri and today we have
the privilege of speaking with Professor
Emma ramp bloom a leading figure in AI
ethics and policy Emma is the current
chair of unesco's world Commission on
the ethics of scientific knowledge and
technology and a member of the UN
secretary General's advisory body on AI
she played a pivotal role in drafting
the UNESCO recommendation on the ethics
of AI which was adopted by 193 member
states in 2021 with her extensive
background in philosophy ethics and AI
policy Professor Ram Bloom brings a
wealth of knowledge to our discussion
welcome to regulating AA we are honored
to have you with us thank you for having
me we have a global audience uh our
audience is you know made up of policy
makers uh in the US and uh Europe across
the board uh think tanks entrepreneurs
AI uh passionate uh for Etc so can you
talk a little bit about uh your journey
into the field of a ethics and what
inspired you to pursue this path I
started off actually as a philosopher of
science working on scientific realism um
and applying mathematical logic
approaches such as non-monotonic logic
to try and bring different perspectives
to some obstacles in the then
conversations on scientific realism
which was in towards the end of the 90s
when I was working on my PhD I worked in
that kind of environment moving a little
bit to philosophy of Technology at times
but I also taught formal logic to
symbolic logic to um BC artificial
intelligence students at the University
of South Africa in the computer science
department and that brought me into
contact with many people working in the
then logic based AI well it still exists
but that was the main um the main
approach to AI in those years um and
through that I became a member of the
center for AI research in South Africa
which is a distributed Center among nine
universities and which is
multidisciplinary I was never really
maybe shouldn't say that interested in
the social aspects i l working with the
symbolic stuff and thinking about
science and you know okay how it relates
to reality but more about the testing
concern but then when the driven boom
happened you know and one can different
people will give different dates but you
know let's say here it happened it
really started making an influence um an
impression on me towards 2011 2012 I
started re realizing that being on this
side of the world in South Africa we
really have to start thinking very hard
about what the impact of the data driven
version of AI is and how we can become a
part of it we were already because there
were people working at the center in
this area but um thinking more generally
in terms of vulnerable populations and
also thinking in terms of jobs because
I'm also a head of Department in
philosophy at University of vioria and I
take seriously that I have a
responsibility to think about the
careers of my of my students so I
started the research group in ethics of
AI I got involved with UNESCO came
across my name at the center and you
know one thing led to another um I'm
very much involved in policy work
nowadays I do very little in philosophy
of science pure philosophy of science
hoping to go back to that at some point
but at the moment very much focused on
machine ethics issues and policy issues
wow that's a pretty wide uh area that
you've covered um um Emma one of the
things that we try to do on this um
podcast is really get some Global
perspectives you know I'm based in
Washington DC you are in South Africa uh
you know people talk a lot and we're
going to have this conversation today
but not too much conversation happens
about the global South and I'm really
hoping that we have that conversation
because we have you know it becomes a US
Centric or a eucentric in many cases uh
conservation especially about Ai and AI
regulation so really we are very very
thrilled to have you now you talked
about your role at um UNESCO uh for our
audience that is not familiar can you
explain the significance of unesco's
recommendation on the ethics of AI and
how is it shaping the uh Global AI
governance I think it's one of the most
important documents that we have as
guidelines in terms of thinking about
global governance of AI at the moment
and I say that because it was the first
global approach to thinking about what
AI ethics should be um involving you
know when we and I think about the adoc
expert group that drafted this we were
four people out of each of the six reg
regions of UNESCO um and from all walks
of life different backgrounds different
age groups different genders um
different career paths and this is this
is what UNESCO stands um so it was a
really truly Go Global conversation
firstly which is really important which
had not happened at that time um and
secondly what is important is that it
did not give at that time around 2020
2021 um there were a lot of um you know
hundreds literally of guidelines with
values and principles and nothing else
the recommendation H includes policy
actions the biggest part of the
recommendation is on policy actions on
how to concretize the principles which
are already putting the values in more
concrete terms and that is a really
important contribution because we focus
on different sectors to give to explain
what is needed in every in in in the
main sectors that that we
identified um such as labor such as
gender such as the environment which
were also at that time the environment
was not something that had been
highlighted um in AI ethics
conversations and then the the maybe the
last thing that is really important is
that UNESCO from the beginning committed
to support member states
in adopting and implementing well not
adopting when in implementing the
recommendation because what we realized
because of the the Intercultural
conversations was that obviously
different member states will be at
different stages of Readiness to
implement the
recommendation and it is in that kind of
Realm that one has to be really
culturally sensitive and one has to
think about very very widely about what
kind of factors could possibly imp um
affect a Readiness status we defined
that as a as a moving stasis on a
Continuum of dimensions and they UNESCO
developed then the Readiness assessment
methodology which is a tool that member
states can use to determine the
Readiness at a given State a stage um
and then also there is an an ethical
impact assessment tool which is very far
from just a tick boox exercise so it and
it opened conversations there was a
global forum of AI that UNESCO um uh
hosted and organized in Slovenia in
February this year and it is very clear
that member states across the world are
thinking very hard about you know the
conversations that opened up around the
recommendation and they are let's say 50
to be safe but I actually think it's
closer to 60 member states that have
already gone through the Readiness
assessment exercise which I think is
something to be very proud of wow so 60
states have already gone through this
exercise that's very yeah sorry go ahead
may I add one thing I just want to say
one one more thing and what is also
except about the recommendation is that
it um included a value that is not a
typically Western value um for the first
time and that is the value um speaking
about living
uh I actually now forget about in the
end what it what it came out to after
the negotiations but it is about living
a life of value in a relational way so
understanding that the notion and this
doesn't only come from Africa it comes
from the East as well but the notion
that I am because we are so whatever
happens impacts every person on the
planet um and this was something that
was not so easy to to work into the
recommendation and to keep there but in
the end um it stayed there and and we
are very proud of so for the first time
you got culturally uh you know sensitive
impact into this uh Readiness assessment
so there is now an ethical Readiness
assessment tool that is available so to
speak for countries Emma this is for our
listeners to know that is uh very very
good and we we want to uh later on talk
a lot more about culture uh because
that's uh something of great interest uh
to our listeners but em I as the chair
of uh Comm what do you see as the most
pressing ethical challenges in AI
development and deployment if you were
to list some for our listeners not a
very easy um question um but I will I
have to say that in the domain of AI
which has to be understood is that
whenever we say ethics you think ter we
are saying politics and we are saying
Society MH um so for me the biggest
threat is the widening of the inequality
Gap you know it is it is it is easy to
say that no one should be left behind as
things stand at the moment millions of
people are going to be left behind if we
don't get our act together so and the
main one of the reasons there are many
reasons um there obviously the power
play that in the end you know steers
what happens in terms of AI technology
there is the business model um that's
there AI technology that is focused on
modification of data for profit but it's
focused on geostrategic power balances
as well and it has the extra layer of
bringing the private sector into these
kinds of relations which is new um but
which keeps on happening with emerging
Technologies in climate in space
exploration it's everywhere now Quantum
Computing we have to find ways to deal
with this um but when people the most
important driver of this for me is
actually the way in which people talk
about in data sets they talk about it as
if there is something as if this is a
deviance from the norm and the norm is
neut a neutral data set there is no such
thing we are using human data humans are
biased beings so there is a
political codification in any data set
so what we have to be sensitive for is
what is the story being told in that
political code that is hiding behind the
data
that is what is important and together
with that I mean obviously I can say a
lots of concrete things in terms of
Africa you know in terms of
penetrability in terms of internet
connection and connectivity South Africa
had huge electricity problems for a
while we seem to be out of it you know
really touch wood but um so I can say
stuff like that and it is important and
I really think that connectivity should
be a basic human right in the era in
which we we live um but what is also
important is that we think about buyers
in the right way and then that we fight
with everything that we have the
exclusion of the global south from
Global conversation on AI it has been
addressed in various ways I mean I gave
UNESCO as an example the UN advisory
body also Drew people from across the
world um and I'm proud to have um been
there as somebody who lives who has
lived for more than 50 years in Africa
um close to 60 actually um but um so I
think and there are different ways in
which we should fight that and one way I
would just say is language to portray
the global South as consumers of AI
technology fits certain narratives we
are not just consumers we are also
producers of this technology and we have
the right to be producers of this
technology for me that's the biggest
issue there are other issues and must
say one maybe that's really important is
access to training in stem disciplines
and the gender imbalances far as that is
concerned across the world not just in
the global South um it's very go and do
a gender check in um Silicon Valley in
the big tech companies and you will be
astounded um or a diversity check so
those things are also really important
but yeah so let me stop I mean there are
many but those two for me are the most
important ones you touched on some very
very important uh topics um Emma and
hopefully we can get into it a little
bit one is your worry about millions of
people getting left behind as you said
about global South um you know not being
in the conversations obviously as you
said there are some challenges and we
want to talk a little bit about that but
do you think now at so I'm want to
address that topic and then you talked
about the geopolitical
nature and we we have a lot of you know
uh we have Senators members of Congress
Etc that come on our show from the US
and around the world uh so I want to uh
touch on that topic too because that's
become a very very important issue in
the US at least but talking about uh the
global South and this is for you know
talk to our listeners in the US and
Europe who are maybe you know not as
aren't those conversations not being
held at places like G7
G20 uh even at Davos and others so do
you see more needs to be done and when
you say Global South is there a voice
for Global South per se because Global
South you know if you were to ask an
American what is global South they
couldn't tell you in many cases what is
the global South so okay so let's say uh
there is the global South should they
have a unified
voice uh and then the other thing is
what else can be done according to Emma
to get the voice of the global South in
this discussions so that millions of
people don't get left behind so this is
for our audience that you know we have
members of Congress who listen we have
their staff will listen uh so this would
be a chance for you to tell them do you
think there's more openness towards
these kinds of conversations at the
fural that you mentioned but there can
never be enough openness um because
there is a huge deficit so we have to
make up for time that has been lost and
you know we can speak the rest of the
day why the time has been lost why the
global South is excluded um but maybe
you know let's not focus on that too
much although it it really plays a role
in terms of of the business model that
at the moment drives AI technology um
which is something that from my point of
view should change very fast and even if
it only changes in the global South
because you know what in the next 20
years or so if you look at the world
economic Forum statistics a very large
part of the population of the world will
be Africa we are changing the world in
which these young people will live and
in which they will make decisions and
they have a right to be taken seriously
and we had better take them seriously um
quite frankly so for that reason I think
we can never have enough I don't think
it should be a unified voice the
situation in Africa is not the same as
in Latin America is not the same as in
parts of Asia um and also even just on a
on the African continent I mean we have
huge differences we have you know
literally hundreds of thousands of
dialects we have different cultures we
have different economic situations we
have different political situations but
we can speak with one voice if we have
to I don't think it's a unified voice I
think it is Voices That should be heard
and it's really important also if we
think in terms of something that's also
important from a kest um point of view
for instance is digital literacy but we
should be talking about digital literacy
there are different approaches different
ways of making
meaning um or of meaning making
in terms of how people engage with this
technology and everybody is impacted
even those that don't exist as data
points because they don't exist as data
points so um yeah you know so we not
unified change the language get
everybody involved um and listen because
you know what we have a lot to offer um
we have a lot to bring and there are
there's a lot of innovation happening on
this side of the world and a lot of
really hard thinking in terms of govern
that would enrich current conversations
that you know might become a little bit
monotone if it's just the same people
saying the same things over and over
again that's helpful I want to touch on
another Point important point that you
brought up is language uh the current
language of AI to a large extent is
English because it's coming from Silicon
Valley um from the US now to a certain
extent let's just say in Europe with
Mistral and a few others how
important is for our listeners is
language uh whether it's from a cultural
issue or just bringing people along
because uh you know I have had Europeans
who are afraid their entire cultures
like in Finland and others are going to
get left behind and get wiped out
because if AI just becomes a language of
English but Africa has as you said so
many different dialects so tell our
listeners why is language important from
a cultural and from an AI standpoint
from a cultural VI point of view because
it's about values it's about the way in
which life is approached we express our
culture in our language you know if you
think about you know people say French
is very idiomatic okay what does that
say about the French way of living so it
does it has it carries over to how you
find yourself in the world how you
experience your world and how you
navigate the world that you find
yourself in and how you try to shape it
in ways that you can deal with so it is
exceptionally important and
unfortunately you know this issue is
obviously exacerbated I I share the
concern of countries like Finland but
it's exacerbated on this side of the
world because it goes hand inand with
being invisible with the data poverty
with not having access to maybe the
necessary levels of compute
um so it is exacerbated so in in terms
of language in terms of values um
language um terms of culture and values
language is really important language is
also important in terms of AI um because
we should think about changing the
business model and but that having said
that now we have to understand something
so we say okay we want and we have many
many um entities like that we want to
build Grassroots Comm communities that
build natural language processing say um
applications for particular indigenous
languages we have leapa ai in South
Africa we have masani natural language
processing there are many examples I
give the South Africans on once because
I'm proudly South African but what
happens then is that you have to take
into consideration that you have a huge
responsibility if you start working on
building such applications on the data
of people that have not existed
necessarily as data points before you
have to protect their dignity you have
to protect their privacy you have to
protect their culture you have to be
transparent with what will happen um to
their language if it becomes in this way
part of the AI world so it isn't
something that can ever and nothing in
AI could and should ever be done without
responsibility so one should be also be
able to reflect on this but that it's
needed and that Africa can play a huge
role um in this respect is really
important hopefully it will happen with
emphasis on retaining ownership of data
I cannot stress that enough um we can
talk long stories about data
colonization it's a real thing um and we
should stand very strong against that um
you know let me just say that but be
proud of owning your own data don't give
it away way um without thinking and um
governments should take this seriously
so owning your own data is important and
language defines culture uh as you have
said you touched on another point which
is a current theme right now in
Washington is the geopolitical issues of
AI it's become a very uh important and a
sensitive subject um and there is a
perspective that uh you know that there
are National Security implications of
AI and do you believe the global South
is going to get caught in the middle of
this whole
geopolitical challenge I mean just being
putting it bluntly it's the geopolitical
challenge of in AI is the United States
and you know uh so to speak the Western
world uh framework against let's say
China for example so do you where does
the global South F in here you know I
can give two answers one is nowhere um
and the other one is it has a role but
the place for it in the current business
model is to see it as a dumping place
for um maybe you labor um uh what's the
word attitudes if you think of the um
ghost the so-called ghost workers of AI
if you think of all the people um
driving the um reinforcement learning
aspects of generative AI who are living
in very bad conditions who are not
treated according to International labor
law the AI business model needs a
dumping site in that sense it needs a
place where it can go to to get cheap
labor to do things fast um and you know
one should maybe not say that but it one
should actually shout it from the
rooftops tops because that is what it is
that's the truth of it so if you think
in terms of geopolitical concerns and
you think about National Security um
issues you think about also of course
data sovereignty and sovereignty of
States all of those concepts are in a
sense and you know it's frightening to
say this but are in a sense upful grabs
we should protect the national
sovereignty of States but we should
retain the ability to get together to
address Global issues and one such issue
is the use of AI in the military domain
in general it's not you know robots
walking around with guns it's much more
subtle much much more subtle that's why
we need voices from the global South to
so that we can ensure that we are not
nowhere in this power play and that we
can change it that we can disrupt it
because we are talking about a
disruptive technology anyway many things
have to be disrupted in terms of how we
see the world um so that we can have a
clu a truly Global World Order if we
talk about AI technology so what you're
saying is one point you said is global
South is nowhere but in some cases it's
also becoming a Dumping Ground And I
think Emma what you were referring so
that our audience can understand is that
whole controversy of where uh labor in
Africa has been used for data labeling
and things of that nature uh especially
when they've had to deal with some
really horrible uh data applications
that really could cause uh mental stress
and those kinds of things Emma uh you
brought up a point of military
applications so I want to just follow up
on that point is what are your thoughts
on the ethical implications of AI in
military applications okay that's also
something that I can talk about for the
rest of the day but let's um of course
the ethical implications are also
political implications you know the
ethics of AI is the politics of AI we
have to understand that the biggest
concern for me is the the problems
around transparency and the and the and
the power that the different guises of
surveillance of digital surveillance and
the different roles that misinformation
can play so yes we we you know one big
topic is the lethal autonomous weapon
systems and big concerns around should
basically mathematical algorithms be
allowed to kill people um and you know
we can have lots of conversations about
that and you know would that be would a
be fewer mistakes than humans would make
not no feelings of guilt all of those
things really important but we miss what
is happening in front of our
we and it's not just cyber security um
there are many different ways in which
artificial intelligence technology is
used to disrupt National Security of
sovereign states and we have to
understand we have to learn to recognize
this I really think it's important that
there is awareness around this across
the world in all governments and that
this is something that is taken into
account to together with data ownership
and other concerns that I've mentioned
already by governance governments want
to work with companies or entities from
the other side of the world to build a
data center in your country what is it
that you're going to be giving up um so
for me it's a really it's a very wide
issue um much wider than just concerns
around human dignity um you know it's
not just about robots killing people
it's a lot more subtle than that but a
lot more dangerous at the same time and
it's happening it's here it's the
biggest threat to Safety and Security
globally and it should be taken very
very very seriously so uh what you're
saying is we need to definitely uh take
it seriously and that data sovereignty
uh is very important you touched on one
point and I want to just uh bring up
data centers you know uh right now they
are the topic dour so to speak uh these
hyperscalers are setting up data centers
around the world you know Singapore has
probably the second largest now they're
going across Malaysia um so and I've uh
seen that uh Kenya has become a big uh
location for data centers where
Microsoft and um you know uh I think a42
have put uh some major investments in
there do you see uh that as a good thing
and it's Kenya because data centers need
several things they need land okay they
need energy they need water and they
need uh you know basically those are
some of the infrastructures things they
need any thoughts on whether there
should be more data centers but then you
are also coming up on this conundrum of
energy and
sustainability uh that comes up uh that
you talked about earlier so just uh
quickly some thoughts on uh data center
since you brought it up if you think in
terms of global governance concerns and
you think about sharing the benefits of
AI globally because everybody is
contributing to AI technology not not
because one part of the world is
consumers and the other part um is
producers we do need we do we the the
the huge amounts of data that the
current Trend in terms of AI technology
needs is you know for most countries it
is not possible to to to be a role
player on that level so what we need is
bilateral multilateral collaborations in
terms of data sharing but of course with
many things in place not just data
ownership many other things um so we
need it and I think it's a good thing
and I think it is a sustainable in
Africa because it will you know it it
will there's like you know on the other
day I read a document that said there's
177 data Cent centers that are going to
be constructed on this continent within
the next decade by various big role
players we do need them um but apart
from the natural resources they of
course need funding and they need talent
we have a lot of talent in Africa but we
need more because of the way in which
the population is growing um and for
many other reasons so I think for me the
most important thing is yes data centers
are important but again data sovereignty
should never become data localization so
do not sell your soul for the data
center think about your population first
think about your ownership think about
what you know what is it that you're
really trying to achieve do you want to
be um you know prescribed to um for what
you know what will be processed what it
will be used for those kinds of things
so I really hope that governments on
this side of the world will think very
clearly and rationally when they make
these kinds of decisions and Emma you
work with the African Union development
agency and the African Commission on
human and people's rights and you you
mentioned in the future how Africa with
its young uh and growing population is
going to play a key role what key
insights have you gained about AI
governance in Africa from those roles
this is for our listeners who might not
be as familiar I think I've mentioned a
lot of them um I think what is really
important is that we should push to make
our voices heard that um we should
ensure that there are African voices
this that we should prove that we um
also can put our money where our mils
are so in the sense that when we say
that we have talent when we say that we
are also producers of AI technology to
be able to show this um and we should
work very hard to get there we need to
fix a few things I'll mention two one is
Education and
Training um and this is really really
really important we have excellent
universities um and centers of
technology in Africa but we do not have
enough and Africa is huge um so it's
very difficult and it has different
communities it's not all cities how to
do that is for instance not to fall for
hype from Big Tech that will tell you
that generative AI is the solution to um
all the problems for Rural communities
who never had access well you know what
if they don't have access to schools
they might not have access to to
electricity they might not be connected
they might not have the devices needed
and maybe they're not interested because
their values and their culture will not
feature in the knowledge that is created
through generative AI applications not
knowledge by the way I don't think it is
knowledge but yeah so we have to be
aware we have to think very very
seriously about how to revolutionize the
way you think about education in Africa
and they also we need to make bilateral
um and multilateral agreements and help
each other so that we can we can address
this issue the other issue obviously has
to do with problems related to Poverty
problems related to energy problems
related to you know something that
people don't think about but something
like food security so the the the
situation in which people live um the
perance also how seriously they think
about things like technology for some
people this is really I mean can I just
have food on my table for my children
today thank you very much um so we have
to understand that also and we have to
have to address those kinds of issues
and in that context really think about
connectivity as a basic human right for
Africans so you made some very important
points uh education training uh you
talked about U you know obviously
poverty food security uh but Education
and Training which is also an important
thing in the US and other countries too
because there's involves reskilling uh
of a
Workforce uh and you talked about how
especially in rural communities is there
a role for uh remote education online
education because now uh you know why
have the students come and you are at a
university so I don't want to take uh
your uh universities work away but why
have students come to universities when
universities can go to the students sua
yeah well that is a really hard question
um I think it is because there maybe we
should just take a lot well not maybe
definitely we should take a lot more
care in what quality of remote learning
is like there is a lot still to be said
for creating knowledge as a social
construct as something that happens only
in groups that that happens only in
interaction and you can walk up to a
person and quickly say something and you
can read their body language so for
those kinds of things I think inperson
contact of some form is still really
important humans are social beings but
that remote education can play a really
important role stands you know as a fact
um but again obviously on my side of the
world we need to fix the connectivity
and those kinds of issues first and we
have to take care how much surveillance
we allow into the conversation if you
think about all the court cases around
the proor issues we have to be careful
we have to be very very very careful but
what is it that we allow what is it are
we objectifying our
students um do we have the right to do
that in in return for Quality education
so none of these issues are just simple
issues that we could just say yeah this
is the solution AI for good it's this is
the way to go it is not just an easy
path it might be the way to go but it
will always ask for a lot of reflection
and a lot of thinking around
responsibilities and transparency and
accountability well that's uh absolutely
the you know the group dynamics plays a
key key role uh not just in education
but just building yourself up um just
shifting to um you know you had a
tremendous uh role with
UNESCO um and you talked about it
earlier but uh in the US uh there is
some level of skepticism of
international organizations but so what
do you believe that International regul
uh organizations like UNESCO should play
in the global AI governance there is a
role for them um you know being a member
of the UN advisory body I'm very much
aware on a really personal level maybe
more than I was before um of this kind
of resistance and some of it is
certainly Justified some of it is not
some of it is playing and reacting to
Hype um around this technology and we
have to be very that's why we have to be
clear-headed when we think about AI I
think there is a role because many of
these
intergovernmental organizations have the
Machinery to um to do things that that
cannot be done by by the private sector
yes it's on the one hand a drawback for
instance if you think in terms of UNESCO
um I haven't played a big role at UNESCO
at a very small part of a small part of
of UNESCO I just want to say that um but
if you think of UNESCO I mean everything
that is done everything that is written
all the reports are addressed to member
states so there is a need to also speak
to Civil Society organizations and at k
um when we have our our conference every
year we invite Civil Society
organizations and we are going we're
working very hard to change the the kind
of balance um of how much input they can
actually make at these conferences so
but again the those kinds of of entities
have sometimes a lot of what is already
needed to make changes in how they were
and to reach out to many more people at
once that can maybe be done by just one
um private sector entity or one Civil
Society organization the way for me Way
Forward is you know interconnecting and
that's you know that was part of the
value the non-west and value in the
UNESCO recommendation the
interconnectedness of everybody
interconnecting these kinds of inter
intergovernmental um entities with civil
society organizations and with the
private sector
and taking care on who calls the shots
um because it should be a joint Endeavor
it should not be handed over to to to
one of these so I think that in that
sense there should there might be a lot
of change coming in how these kinds of
entities should operate but that we
still need them I think yes we do so
there is a role for it uh not an
exclusive one um Emma uh you passed the
eui ACT uh in the US we're not going to
pass anything we're in a presidential
race and uh in the conversations that
we've had with uh leaders here they
believe we need a low touch we want to
keep Innovation going do you think uh
Africa or the global south or African
Union will have their own AI uh act so
to speak or they're going to kind of
rely
on uh or with the AI UI act or stuff
this is people these are some of our
listeners want to know this from you is
is there going to be something coming
from Africa yes there is something
already on the table from Africa there
is an AI strategy for the continent okay
that was developed by the African Union
and there are also other um
uh you know can't find the word
processes um Continental wide at the
moment there is a white paper um
and no we don't want to rely on the EU
act yes the EU Act is really important
for us and I'll tell you why because it
is the first regulation that addresses
the transboundary and um uh nature of
big Tech so there are ways now to keep
them accountable across borders and this
is sorely needed for many reasons and
this because one of them is that and
this is also why global regulation is
important this might be the only
protection that some people will ever
have in some parts of the world so it is
important it's also important for the
trans um the transnational nature of it
it reaches beyond the borders of the EU
but we don't want to rely on that only
we want to have our own strategy and we
want to have our own act it will look
different from the EU because there's a
lot more diversity in Africa um and I'm
really really hoping that we we will our
strategy will be built on a different
kind of business model um but we will
see how far that kind of idealism goes
um but yeah no certainly we're working
we're working on our own stuff and we
have our own stuff going strongly great
so for our listeners there's something
in the works and it'll come uh hopefully
soon they might get inspired by the EU
but it's going to be based on their own
conditions uh that exist in Africa um
Emma you have obviously you know you
wear so many different hats and so many
different interests one of the things
that fascinated me is that you have the
the intersection of technology and
humanity is a kind of a recurring theme
in your work how do you envision human
technology relations evolving I mean you
know you also have talked about the
impact of robots and things like that
and we we had some uh incredible experts
in this uh area uh that have come in but
just if you can just briefly uh touch on
that uh because that's an area for our
listeners that are very interested you
know I think something that we have to
realize is that we have as humans always
interacted with tools with technology of
some kind to shape the world in which we
live to make that world navigatable to
make that world
livable um so it is not something new
what is new with AI is simply that it
touches Us in so many different layers
of our lives and that it touches
everybody it does You Can't Hide You
have the right to be forgotten but that
you know that that definition is
shrinking and shrinking because you know
if just think in terms of the technology
if your data has been used to train a
model cannot delete your data people say
they they will do it they are not
telling you the truth so it is a it's a
part of it's is a characteristic is a is
a natural human trait to in some way use
technology to shape the human world our
life world as it's called in
postphenomenology which is a field of
thinking in philosophy um so but we have
to understand that it's not just a
shaping there is a co-shaping technology
shapes us right back and that is that is
where things become really interesting
what kind of a role do you want to give
to technology in the co-shaping of the
world in which you find yourself because
it co- shapes your moral values whether
you want to believe it or not um really
important work and interesting work done
on this but you know if Alexa the
default voice is female what message is
being sent out um it's very very small
example very you know simple example but
it explodes so what kind of a role you
want to give it what kind of a role do
you want to give it in art in your
experience of Art in the creation of art
there's a lot of really important work
being done in the performative Arts with
the help of AI technology and what does
it mean that technology can shape the
way in which we experience art well it
has a piano is technology
but now it's different because it's more
personal so you know I really think that
we should all keep on thinking un last
it's been written about this um in the
in Academia and I won't bore you with
that but there are many different voices
thinking from different fields about
this but it is something that we should
maybe put also to Ordinary People in the
streets to think about how it is that
they are interacting with technology and
what role is that they are allowing
technology you will not allow somebody
that you don't trust to have an impact
on your life if you think about how
passionately young people talk about
relationships and Trust okay does that
carry over to the way in which you
interact with technology and the role
that you allow it in your life and if
not why not at least have an answer um
those kinds of questions I think are
really really important for everybody to
reflect yeah the RO of I mean it's
taking over um whether no matter what
age group you are and where you are I
mean it's um taken over our life uh Emma
I have like maybe 60 other questions and
I could go on and on I think we'll need
to have you come back again but towards
the end we do a lightning round of
questions these are uh just uh onew uh
answers let's see uh what your thoughts
are we've covered a lot of ground so uh
you ready yep okay uh Innovation or
regular UL ation what should come first
for AI together they should come
together can't have the one without the
other okay uh Global or Regional
approach to AI governance Regional
informed by global but Regional okay a
centralized or decentralized framework
for AI regulation decentralized okay uh
I think I know what you're going to say
but let me give it to you it's uh human
rights or economic growth what should AI
prior
human rights okay uh public or private
sector who should lead in the AI ethics
development you know what I want to say
none Civil Society should lead it civil
society good answer yes
um should there be Universal or
culturally relative a both okay um
should there be transparency or
performance which is more crucial for AI
systems transparency okay uh
precautionary or permissive approach to
AI development precautionary okay uh
final one uh what do you think will it
be cooperation or competition that will
drive uh Global AI development afraid it
will be competition but it should be
collaboration okay uh that's fantastic
Emma finally um for our Global audience
as I said we've covered a lot of and
there's so much more I wanted to cover
uh can you give some um you know action
items some thoughts what gives you hope
for AI governance what are the areas you
uh are most concerned about but some
action items uh that our audience can
take uh from this very very uh important
conversation we had today let we start
from a high level I think we should take
a lot of care to not be taken up by some
of the current false dichotomies in the
in the narrative around AI ethics versus
safety harm versus risk um
Innovation versus regulation and you
know the reason why I I make the choices
that I made in this lightning round of
questions is because the only
sustainable AI technology is responsibly
deployed and well designed first and
then developed and deployed and used AI
technology we want it to be sustainable
if you want to have talk about AI for
good you don't want it you don't want to
have millions of cold cases you don't
want people to die you don't want people
to sit with serious mental health issues
you you want to think about
intergenerational Justice you want to
have a better world so for that is why
the one is necessary for the other um
and these false dichotomies um think
whose conversations are you furthering
when you fall for them and then moving
down to to every every person you know
if you think back to the enlightenment
in the okay there's difference but
depending on who you speak to but 1600s
1700s um you know to try and satisfy
everybody um the the slogan for the
enlightenment was have the courage to
think for yourself and that is more true
than ever engage with AI technology
Embrace AI technology but think what it
is that you are embracing how you are
allowing it into your life what it is
that you allow it to do and what you
should not allow it to do um yeah I
think that's I can go on but maybe well
so I think there are some great uh
action points embrace the technology
allow it but think for yourself and see
what it can do for you uh uh great uh
point
uh thank you Emma really those uh
invaluable insights um are just
incredible your work really you know the
intersection of philosophy ethics and a
policy especially bringing the views of
the global South the diverse cultural
values and human rights uh was very very
enlightening and as we continue to
navigate the rapidly evolving landscape
of AI voices like Professor ramp blooms
are are essential to ensure that we our
approach to regulation is both
comprehensive but nuanced so to our
listeners thank you for tuning in to
regulating AI until next time this is
Sanjay Puri keep exploring the critical
questions surrounding AI governance and
its impact on our shared future Emma
thank you so much this was uh fabulous
like I said I could have gone on there's
at least 20 other questions I had but
thank you for being on the broadcast
thank you for the conversation
