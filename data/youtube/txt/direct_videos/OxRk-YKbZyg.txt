and and what AI really does is it's it's
also a great equalize so you know you
want people who might not otherwise have
the resources to work on this problem to
do it you know it can be a question of
of a few students uh somewhere around
the world with a few laptops uh and they
could you know download amazing large
language models or other AI models from
from different platforms and they can
work and innovate uh you know maybe just
with a few people and and they can come
up with amazing solutions to to big
problems so so we're big fans of Open
Source you know it's it's a it's it's
just for the overall capability and and
ability to advance the the science and
the technology but also for you know
democratizing the
access welcome to the regulating AI
podcast join host Sanjay pury as he
explores the dynamic and developing
world of artificial intelligence
governance each episode features deep
Dives with global leaders at the
Forefront of regulating AI respons
responsibly tackling the challenges
using AI can bring about headon and
enabling balance without hindering
[Music]
Innovation welcome to the regulating AI
podcast artificial intelligence AI
stands at the Forefront of a
technological Revolution so how do we
regulate it without stifling The
Innovation that has brought us to this
incredible uh place in time our podcast
features inside from various
perspectives from industry leaders to
government officials to advocacy groups
from around the world together they
address pivotal questions that are
needed to create fair and practical
legislation I'm very excited to have
Patrick guire with us today he's the
head of global Affairs for Silo AI one
of the largest private AI labs in Europe
he was also the AI and data policy lead
for
Tesla I invited him on this show as it
is very important to get many different
perspectives towards framing AI
legislation and we need to get a global
perspective on this transformative
technology welcome Patrick it's an
absolute pleasure to have you on the
regulating AI
podcast thank you so much Sanjay it's
it's a great honor to be here wonderful
Patrick we have a global audience we
have uh members of you US Congress
members of the Senate uh their staff
think tanks industry around the world
listening could you give our listeners
an overview of Silo AI its mission in
the AI landscape and then also as the
head of global Affairs what are your
primary uh roles and responsibilities at
the
company absolutely I'd be I'd be happy
to uh so Silo AI is is as you mentioned
in the intro uh one of the largest
private AI AI labs in Europe uh our
mission is is to ensure and that the
Europe actually has an AI Flagship
company moving forward uh and that's
sort of the real Mission we're working
towards working very hard towards uh
every day what we actually do uh is is
we build Market leading open source
large language models at this point uh
with with the overall intent to really
enhance sort of European digital
Excellence digital sovereignity but also
to to democratize access to llms uh
which which are definitely at the risk
of sort of being concentrated into the
hands of the few uh we we you know help
our customers with anything from from
developing their own products and
services uh based on AI uh we we do more
of a sort of Consulting uh approach but
we also now now have our own growing
product business uh so we really work
sort of full scale on AI from from you
know from the the research development
part up to supporting companies with the
deployment of of AI now to your to your
second question what what I do and what
my role is I I like to joke that you
know we chose Global Affairs because
it's vague enough that it can mean a lot
of different things um my my background
is in the world of of policy and and the
public sector so so of course public
policy advocacy and and sort of
compliance related matters are very much
at the heart of of what I do but since
we are very much a startup uh you know
it's it's sort of an all hands on Deck
kind of situation so I also work a lot
with with strategic Partnerships
particularly with the public sector um
both on on sort of collaborative
projects but also on trying to figure
out what the the best use cases and
value generating use cases for AI can be
in the public sector and and
additionally I I do a little bit of work
in in the sort of communications and and
media relation space as well so it's
it's a it's a full desk with a lot of
things going on
well that's uh wonderful to hear uh
Patrick for our listeners who might not
be as um aware of what's happening in
the AI sector in Europe because we have
listeners outside Europe uh in North
America South America uh Africa and Asia
uh it's really heartening to note that
uh AI is really thriving in Europe um so
you talked about a couple of things if I
may follow up your focus uh Patrick is
heavily on open sourcing of these large
language models there is at least in the
United States there are two camps on
whether open source close source so to
speak if you see Facebook uh they've got
llama now llama 3 is coming out um
actually Google also now put their toe
in the open source with uh Gemma uh a
model that they have announced um and
then you have closed source with open AI
Microsoft uh Etc now obviously there are
proponents that say you know Innovation
thrives uh through open source and
that's where we come to and then there
are people who say hey we're going to
give especially when you give these
weights and other uh models over there
are maybe Nations and people who uh
might not have the best intentions
where do you come out on this whole
argument of Open Source versus closed
source so so I think it's actually
pretty simple for us to answer that
question as as a company I mean we are
very big fans of Open Source um you know
we're a company of about 300 people over
half of whom have phds in the field very
research heavy company uh people used to
working in a sort of very collaborative
environment um in an open environment
that is very Pro Innovation and try to
solve some of the you know most
difficult problems we as as humankind
face and we we firmly believe uh that
that open source is sort of at the heart
of this um and and the the ability for
us as humankind to solve these problems
um you know it's it's it's going to be
more likely that they will be solved
through collaboration um and and what AI
really does is it's it's also a great
equalizer right so you know you want
people who might not otherwise have the
resources to work on this Pro problem to
do it you know it can be a question of
of a few students uh somewhere around
the world with a few laptops uh and and
they could you know download amazing
large language models or other AI models
from from different platforms and they
can work and innovate uh you know maybe
just with a few people and and they can
come up with amazing solutions to to big
problems so so we're big fans of Open
Source uh you know it's it's a it's it's
just for the overall capability and and
ability to advance the the science and
the technology but also for you know
democratizing the access um because if
if you know if you go more of the sort
of closed route uh it as as some
technology development over the last 20
years have gone you know you do see a a
trend towards towards sort of power
being centralized into the hands of the
few and uh and you know I'm a political
Scientist by training myself and and
generally speaking in in political
science when when power is centralized
that's that's bad news so so it's also a
a good idea to fight back against sort
of monopolies and and the concentration
and centralization of power uh by using
uh open source methods now now of course
it's important to to give the caveat you
know it's it's open source uh is not a
business model you know and to build a
commercial business model you also need
to have proprietary technology uh you
need to have be able to provide added
value uh to to customer customers as do
we uh but but the the foundational part
training these these foundational models
uh we do that together with a university
partner and and we are all in on open
source and and maybe the last point I'll
make on open source is that you know
there's also different levels of open
right and I think this term has become
uh in in the past few maybe months maybe
a year uh it's also been used as a
marketing tool so a lot of companies
like to say that they're open when you
know when you dig a little bit deeper
you see that well maybe they published
their model on a platform but they
didn't say anything about the data or
the model weights uh or maybe they did
so I would also encourage your listeners
to be very skeptical when they hear
companies and and different uh actors
using the term open and really sort of
digging deeper into to what they
actually mean by
it so um again you made some very
important points for our listeners
especially policy makers that open
source will democratize AI where
somebody with sitting in a laptop
anywhere it could be in a small town in
Iowa it could be in uh a village in
Finland or in Denmark or Norway Etc
students uh working at a university will
have access to this uh perspective and
this is really important for our policy
makers who are struggling with this but
they also have been fed this notion that
if they do this uh uh with you know the
weights and everything else the training
weights and things like that it'll give
Bad actors the ability to create bio
weapons and stuff like that what do you
say to that to our policy makers who are
cons remember they're not AI experts
they're being uh getting this
information and they're getting it from
you also so what would be your uh answer
to that pck sure I mean i' I've had
numerous conversations about this topic
with policy makers on on both sides of
the Atlantic and I think I think the the
the fear or the worry is is is very
reasonable and and I don't want to sort
of in any way negate it and say that
it's it's something that we shouldn't
think about I just think it's important
for us to sort of level set where we are
right now with the technology and where
we could be in in a matter of you know
five years or 10 years or something um
today's large language models uh I mean
it's it's perhaps a little simplistic to
just call them you know prediction
engines but it's kind of what they are
they they are I mean I don't think you
can find any definition by which they
are conscious or or you know can act as
agents independently they are very much
under the control of of of humans uh and
I mean uh there has been open really
open source large language models that
are very capable for about a year now uh
after the whole sort of chat GPT CRA and
and we haven't seen uh any any
remarkable impact so I think uh you know
usually the burden of of evidence is on
the one making a claim and and if the
claim is that op Source AI models will
lead to something u x whatever the
scenario is um you know I I do think
that that sort of we would have seen
some signs of that now this is not to
say that we shouldn't take this threat
seriously and I do believe that this is
more a matter of of enforcement and a
matter of of sort of oversight that that
government agencies can provide together
of for in collaboration with industry uh
but at the end of the day uh you know we
really find ourselves at a situation
where if this technology gets developed
anyway somewhere and it's closed um the
same threats in in my mind are still
there it's just other people dealing
with them now if that development
happens in the open there is a
collective effort and we are more aware
I mean none of us knows what happens in
inside of open AI development whereas
you can very openly follow what we and
and many others do just by going to
hugging face and downloading the model
card uh and and so I do think that again
uh if if we go to closed route for this
reason we anyway implicitly place a lot
of faith in the companies at the
Forefront of this technological
development without any government
oversight so to our
policym is saying is keep the Innovation
but you could have oversight and
enforcement to protect uh uh it from Bad
actors because anyway if it is closed we
are dependent on the ethics and the
values of these big companies which uh
sometimes uh has been questionable so
Patrick taking that question you also
touched on a very important topic that
is being currently being discussed and
debated in the US Congress in light and
in perspective of social media right now
the town Halls of the world are
dominated by four five six uh big tech
companies and the fear in the US
Congress and around uh policy makers of
the world is that the same thing should
not happen to AI because building large
language models as you've seen with your
organization is an expensive process
getting the gpus the talent Etc and
large companies can't do it how do
Regulators make sure that we support
this they support this effort but there
is no monopolistic Behavior because just
last week we saw mistal which is was a
heavily open- Source company has taken
an investment from Microsoft now maybe
it's all good and everything is great
but my point here is it's large tech
companies are basically investing even
in these Innovative early stage
companies whether it's an anthropic and
others so your thoughts on Monopoly and
what can legislators here do about that
now personally you know I'm I'm been
very worried about sort of the
development in in the technology sector
more broadly over the last few decades
and and the concentration of of sort of
both power and wealth that that has
happened uh I do think it has you know
broad ranging implications that are sort
of go far uh far far above and you know
beside what what maybe the purview of
this conversation is uh you know but
social more socioeconomic implications
uh and I think we've we've seen uh very
strong evidence of that already
happening now now in my mind sort of the
way policy makers should uh in an ideal
scenario deal with this is I mean we
have Anti-Trust laws we've we've had
antitrust laws for the better part of
you know over a 100 years now it's just
that um they've been enforced very
differently in different areas um now
now I happen to have have lived in the
US a couple of times and and gone to
school at at two great universities
there um and and so I've also studied
American competition policy and law a
little bit and I you know it's it's
fairly evident that that the enforcement
side on on competition has not been very
active in the US over the last few
decades so so I don't really see this as
a matter of of sort of AI regulation I
see this as a matter of ensuring there's
a fair market Market Place uh as there
should be in any domain uh where you
know we we ensure that no players become
too big uh either you know to fail to
refer to the the financial crisis or
then sort of too big to to have too much
control uh to to dominate a market and
and you know we we've seen a lot of
movement in Europe uh in this field so
the digital markets act just entered
into force uh severely limiting the
ability of platform companies uh to to
basically act as as monop police uh you
know Apple obviously being the the
obvious example with with the App Store
and the the 30% fees that is basically
attacks on on smaller companies um and
and so I do think there are a lot of
things policy makers can do uh and and
sort of monopolies be them in Tech or in
you know poultry or or or farming are
bad inherently from the functioning of
just a a market and and basically a free
market liberal Market understanding
so Patrick uh your message to uh
lawmakers is that there are existing
rules laws the Federal Trade Commission
has the ability from an antitrust
whether it's poultry or anything else
the only difference Patrick here is and
we saw this uh maybe about a week ago
with Gemini with some of the
feedback this has serious implications
where we talk about the history of a
country or countries and a generation
getting knowledge and information this
is fine maybe you get one kind of
chicken but this is
about uh complete indoctrination that
could happen so this is a very serious
thing that our uh legislators and
lawmakers need to pay attention to is
what you're saying is we have laws on
the books but they need to be enforced
uh so that's a good point Patrick I want
to uh turn to something which I find
very very interesting and I want you to
tell our listeners why because one of
the discussion points we've had from
listener uh our guests from overseas is
and from even in the US is that AI
should not become basically an English
language western or an American
perspective your company has come out
with um a l well large language model or
at least a model
uh called poro and can you tell us uh a
little bit about it and also why was the
finished language also uh chosen for
that because I find that very very
interesting and our listeners are really
going to find why you chose that very
very
interesting absolutely I'd be happy to
so so poro is actually a Finnish word
for reindeer so uh so you know you can
you can maybe if you think about the
names of some of the other models you
can maybe find a little bit bit of a
joke there uh referring perhaps to
another reindeer like animal uh and I'll
I'll let the listeners figure out sort
of read between the lines here um so so
Porto is a 34 billion parameter large
language model it it actually is not
just in Finnish it's also in English and
it's very capable in English uh and and
also in in about nine programming
languages if I I remember correctly now
it's very natural for us to start with
finish we we're a company founded uh in
Finland and while we do operate
internationally today and and are are
located and have offices in many
countries uh both in inside and outside
of Europe uh we're still a Finnish
Company by sort of you know culture and
and background and I I sit at our
headquarter right now in in beautiful
Helsinki Finland now Finnish happens to
have another quality that is interesting
Finnish is a very different language
than all other European languages so uh
Finnish is actually part of What's
called the feno yugan uh language family
so really the only other European
languages close to Finnish is Estonian
and Hungarian and Hungarian is actually
only really the syntax and the structure
not even the the the actual words so so
Finnish is a great test case for what
our hypothesis uh is so basically one of
the things we're trying to do here at
Silo is build large language models for
what we call low resource languages so
languages with a limited amount of of
tech data available for the model to to
be trained on our hypothesis we was that
by using certain Technologies and
certain approaches you could anyways
make the model very capable in these
languages and Finnish was sort of
selected as the first one uh for the
reasons I just mentioned uh and we're
very happy and very pleased with the
results uh of Bor which we completed a
couple of weeks ago uh and it actually
shows uh you know by far the best uh
performance ever by a model in Finnish
but also uh very much state-of-the-art
in English and this was really the sort
of proof point we were looking for so
now we're in the process of of training
models uh for All European or all
official EU languages um which a lot of
them are low resource languages and this
is really a part of you know our last
topic too it's it's a way of ensuring
that the countries uh in this case
countries that are are relatively
speaking small with small languages
also have access to technology access to
AI models that can operate in their own
language in in not just a way that is is
sort of correct grammatically but also
reflects the values and the culture uh
of that region and of those countries
and and I think that is something that
is is very much
underappreciated that if we realize
solely on English data which a lot of it
is from the US it's not just that it's
the language per se but language is
really a reflection of our culture it's
a reflection of our values so a lot of
things get sort of coded through
language and unless we have models that
can speak natively and are trained
natively in these languages uh you know
there there is a real risk that they
sort of get lost in this next wave of
innovation and we're working hard to
ensure that doesn't happen which is also
a reason why we wanted to open source
the models because that way people in
Lithuania or people in in you know
Serbia can have access the large
language model in their own
language so uh you made a great Point
Patrick as you said to keep the culture
going because that is a fear of
countries in Africa countries in
different parts of Asia as you said
small countries in Europe now is your
expectation just uh because I find this
topic very
fascinating maybe our listeners won't
but is your plan to uh take poro into
different European languages or are you
encouraging Estonia Slovakia and others
to create their own large language
models what what is your expectation
that they keep their culture and things
like what is Silo's role here so uh
we're very I mean we are in the process
of of training models it's it's they're
likely not going to be called poo but
they're they're we're training models
both for the Nordic languages so uh
it'll be reindeer in their languages
just sorry sorry maybe we'll find
another funny animal but but but we have
one coming for the Nordic languages so
so Finnish Swedish Norwegian Danish and
Icelandic uh and then one for all EU
languages so that's 23 official EU
European Union languages but we do have
actually access to data for for a bunch
of additional languages as well so this
really I mean this process starts from
having high quality data in said
language and also uh you know well well
curated data and then of course having
the sort of technological prowess to
also know how that actually fits into
the the model training uh process but
we're very much in the process of
building this we're doing it together
with University Partners so they will be
uh open- Source models and we're super
excited about seeing what type of
Innovations people will build on top of
these base models we're in that game as
well we're we're also doing that
together with customers around the world
but you know that's that's the beauty of
Open Source right is you put it out
there and and things will start
happening and and just you know we're
two weeks in after having published The
Finish model and there's already a bunch
of of sort of fine-tuning experiments
that have been starting on it and it's
it's very exciting well very exciting
indeed um Patrick and uh congratulations
on uh this Venture uh Patrick shifting
uh to the eui act as you know uh a lot
of work has happened and uh it's now uh
on its way hopefully in the next year or
so to get completely enacted what are
your thoughts when you look at it uh is
it uh in its form sufficient or do you
think uh there is a need for further
enhancement uh do you think it is you
know your what are your thoughts on the
eua ACT yeah so I mean I I've followed
the discussion very closely for the past
few years and the Preparatory process
and and as you mentioned uh it it very
much looks like actually the European
Parliament will vote on it next week
which which would uh which would sort of
finally have it enter into Force which I
think from an industry point of view you
know that is good we we want
predictability so the sooner we can get
to a solution the better I think that's
sort of Point number one um which is
true you know for any legislation in any
industry now when it comes to the
specifics uh of the AI act uh you know
the original architecture uh that was
proposed is is really something that we
at Silo have supported even before that
came out so that was based on on sort of
the use cases of AI it's it's it's not
about regulating the technology per se
but about the use cases it gets used to
when it sort of touches consumers and
that touch point is when you regulate it
so you can think about an analogy from
any product safety regulations be it you
know water food something else which is
regulated to ensure that you know no
harmful outcomes happen at the consumer
level and and we think that's that's the
way to go about this um you know then uh
and maybe to to add to your listeners
you know it's it's use case and then
they create basically a risk
categorization so some use cases have
higher risk some have lower and then
depending on that you have different
requirements then during the process uh
of course the chat GPT moment happened
so there was a a demand to also include
regulation on Foundation models or what
ended up being called general purpose AI
models GP for short uh now that's a
little bit of a trickier trickier thing
because then you go from sort of a
product safety regulation to actually
regulating the the core of the
technology uh which is a little bit
different um now I've studied the act
and I've talked to to many many people
in in Europe we are absolutely sort of
in in support of both the spirit and the
letter of the law and while there are
some open questions uh especially
pertaining to the gpai uh requirements
we are confident that by summer 2025
will when when they actually we will
have to comply with them they will be
sorted out we have a very constructive
dialogue with the European commission
and I'm sure we will get to a
satisfactory situation with that but I
mean it's it's also very important to to
mention that you know this is the first
time we're regulating AI as a technology
so there's a lot of things that's
happening for the the first time here
there are definitions that haven't
existed in any EU law before um there
are a lot of question marks that will
inevitably only be solved by the
European court of justice so like a
supreme court in in the US and and that
of course creates uncertainty so so I
would really implore policy makers in in
other markets and other regions to sort
of look at the AI act and its basic
infrastructure and try to emulate that I
think that that's good and that's the
way it should happen but also not uh
sort of go down the path that I've heard
uh some some people talk about which is
sort of AI is a wild west or it's
unregulated because that's simply not
true I mean AI is regulated I think the
US has 434 federal agencies and pretty
much every one of them has some rule
that either directly or indirectly
regulates AI so be it in medicine
development or or you know in energy
Finance whatever There are rules
regarding Al algorithmic use and so on
which is really what AI is so number one
it's not a wild west number two if you
want to regulate do it uh on a use case
level so do it on a use case level uh
it's not a wild west now what people say
uh Patrick is the eui act goes
horizontal in the US we are trying to go
a little vertical by as you said maybe
use case or by industry do you think uh
now obviously keep in mind Patrick
you've lived in the US so we are in an
election here nothing's going to happen
here uh but uh if you were our listeners
are members of Congress uh
Etc what would be your suggestion to
them uh going vertical by industry is
that uh something that they should be
looking at versus what you have done in
the EU so I was actually PR pred to to
take part in the in in the inaugural um
AI Insight Forum in the US Senate uh
last fall uh as as part of my my
previous job uh and I think the dialogue
was actually it surprised me by the
level of of of how well aware people
were of also the sort of risks of
regulating and and I think you know it's
it's sometimes uh pictured as something
maybe a little bit too binary where
either you go over regulation that kills
Innovation or then you don't do any Reg
regulation and and as with most things I
think reality is more nuanced so so if I
could sort of be an adviser to a policy
maker in the US I would say look H it's
pretty evident that technology and sort
of the last wave of innovation if we
talk about mobile or or social media
leaving that field completely
unregulated was probably not the right
way to go uh there's a lot of of sort of
externalities stemming from especially
social media that right Now sort of
individuals or Society Bears the cost of
that and I think you know I'm a I'm a
very sort of Market free market kind of
guy uh but in my mind you know negative
externalities caused by companies they
should also bear the burden of fixing
those externalities and and right now it
feels like the companies um in in social
media for example have sort of gotten
the benefit without paying the price uh
and I I do think it's worth considering
to avoid that that mistake uh in this
round of innovation now then there are a
lot of ideas and even bills uh in
Congress floating around that would go
very far uh you know very strict
limitations on compute power for example
I I do think that's also a very
dangerous road um so you know every
single new wave of Technology at least
starting from the industrial revolution
has also caused a lot of consternation
and a lot of uh fear and and somehow
what has ended up happening is you know
the greatest creation of wealth ever in
humankind by each sort of subsequent
wave so I'm very optimistic at the heart
of this that you know we we stand in in
front of some of the biggest challenges
humankind has ever faced be it climate
change or you know a a polarizing world
and and we we see you know I live in a
country with a 800 mile border with
Russia we we see some of the threats
very very clearly here um and are very
realistic about it but what AI can do is
also help us solve a lot of these
problems so so we also don't want to
throw the baby out with the bath
water don't throw the baby out with the
bath water uh be practical seize the
opportunity uh two follow on questions
on that uh lawmakers who come on our
podcast say hey this technology is
evolving so fast I mean Patrick think
about it a year a a little over a year
ago large like chat GPD came out then
we've had uh multimodal come out we've
had uh Agents come out now all kinds of
Rumblings about AGI or super
intelligence or uh those kinds of things
and look at how the memory Windows uh
have uh
grown how do policy makers which you
know look at the eua ACT how long it has
taken How do they
keep draft policy that's going to keep
in mind that this
technology and you're a key part of that
with Silo AI is evolving so fast that by
the time they draft something the
technology could be way way ahead
here it's you know Sanjay it's a it's a
big Challenge and I don't want to
pretend that it's not I I don't think
it's it's in anyone's benefit to sort of
simplify the situation uh but I I do uh
subscri cribe very much to a sort of
first principles approach also to
legislation I think it doesn't always
apply only in physics but we can also
use it in the in the sort of human realm
or in the in the societal realm and and
what I would say is you know key wordss
are sort of flexible Nimble adaptable um
I I think we we have to be able to adapt
our way of legislating and creating
policies to a new world it's it's not
just AI the the world's uh the sort of
change of pace is is only increasing and
it's only going to increase even further
over the coming decades so no no matter
if it's something as as sort of
regulating a fundamental technology like
AI or you know a food safety regulation
they are going to have to be more
adaptable to to sort of emerging
technology so I I do think there is room
for policy Innovation there's room for
innovation in in mechanisms uh but I
would also I mean there are good
examples of of these type of things you
know the eui ACT actually you know it
creates something called the eui office
basically as part of the European
executive part of the European
commission similar to a US Federal
agency uh and and you know that will be
a touch point for companies like us to
have an a very open stakeholder dialogue
to actually try to together figure out
what do these rules in practice on a
company level what do they mean so I
also think think it's it's very much
about a culture of a sort of a
bureaucratic culture that is open to a
dialogue not just sort of listening to
the lobbyists who have the most money
but actually you know listening to
companies at the Forefront of innovation
not just taking their words it's also
listening to researchers and you know
Nos and and others uh but but to have
that open dialogue because the due to
this break neck speed of of innovation
nobody can do this alone uh be a company
or or the government and then maybe the
last point on this I would say is you
know everybody's fighting for AI Talent
now uh and so should the government so
uh then the last part is really how can
the government recruit people with not
just a technical understanding but but
also that but with an understanding of
of you know at at the intersection of
sort of Technology policy law uh
National Security other aspects that
that are very Central
uh to this field and so I would I would
sort of implore governments around the
world to really be ready to invest in
this because uh if if I mean this is not
a joke and I think it's very generally
known that AI Talent is fairly sought
after at this point and and that would
also means things that are usually very
politically difficult um but things like
you know ensuring the salaries are are
high enough to be able to recruit top
level Talent um and I think this is
where we might also have to become a
little bit bit Innovative on the public
sector
side uh as usual you made some great
points if I can follow up on that one is
as you said uh governments should uh
listen to many different stakeholders
obviously not just lobbies but
Innovative companies academics
researchers and others uh which I think
is very important we bring in uh you
know Civil Society groups we bring in
advocacy groups we bring in Educators
ethics experts for our government folks
to listen to uh the other thing you said
was uh which is part of the Biden um
White House um you know executive order
is the talent issue and you said
governments need to beef up or need to
shore up their talent and that means
paying them great salaries now uh the
executive order that om also has passed
is they've changed some of the salary
structure and they've also try to make
some of the immigration policies
great you have you just mentioned up
front you have 300 plus people in AI
That's like our listeners are thinking
wow that's a lot of great AI Talent uh
not that this has anything to do about
regulation but AI talent and then I'll
come to the flip side of that is what is
the secret of uh being able to not just
hiring but keeping because I Pro I'm
sure that every AI company is looking at
Silo Ai and and its employees and saying
to them hey we'll pay you a lot more why
don't you come to us but for governments
around the world as you said they need
to invest in AI but they need to invest
in the talent whether you are government
in Africa your government in Asia Latin
America South America but what have you
been able to do so that our listeners in
these countries know how to do that so I
mean I think it's it's very generical or
or generic sort of issues right I mean
it starts from having an interesting job
you know being able to do cool things at
the Forefront of innovation at at really
I would even say you know before the
Forefront I mean some of the things I
watch are amazing you know Tech Team and
R&D teams work on it it blows me away on
a daily basis especially as someone with
a non-technical background you know I
barely understand what I see on their
screens uh and then when they tell me
what what they can do it's it's amazing
uh and and it's one of the the biggest
Inspirations in my life that that I'm
super excited about to just be able to
work with with some of these these great
minds uh now now how we do it in
addition to to obviously trying to
ensure that people have you know
interesting jobs and interesting tasks
and get to work on on hard problems
because you know smart people want to
work on hard problems um and and being
at the Forefront of innovation you know
we we're very lucky uh in in Finland and
and I think in Europe actually more
broadly we we have a great uh you know
University system that is also very
accessible uh you know we have in
Finland for EU membership EU EU um
citizens education is free up until you
know a PhD uh but it's very high level
so so we have multiple universities in
Finland uh that that really keep
producing great AI Talent um it's
actually a a general misconception that
exists in in large parts of the AI
community that Europe doesn't have ai
Talent it's it's it's actually a lot of
the best e AI talent in the world stem
from Europe I mean um you can look at at
hugging phase you know their entire
founding quartet that're they're all all
European uh they did found their company
in the US and and that's problem from a
European competitiveness point of view
which which I'm not saying there aren't
issues um you know meta they're they AI
team led by the French man Yan leun and
a lot of his team members are French so
and these are just some examples Google
Deep Mind located in London you know
these are these are great European
talents in this space so uh I'm actually
super optimistic uh about both Silo's
future but also about Europe's future
more broadly in the AI space and I think
it all starts from those two things I
mean you need to have a great education
system that gives people that are
interested and inspired the opportunity
to learn and apply themselves and then
you need to provide them with with
challenging interesting
tasks so for our policy makers around
the world uh invest in great academic
institutions that are maybe focused on
AI but AI broadly one of the points
Patrick made was it's not just machine
learning it needs to be ethics it needs
to be policy it needs to be legal a
multi-disciplinary approach to AI um
Patrick now let me take the other side
of the workforce issue uh there have
been lot of uh reports McKenzie IMF say
Etc saying there is going to be massive
job displacement especially White Collar
you know programming uh folks marketing
folks call center folks and numbers up
to 60% Etc
uh legislators who are looking at this
as
saying forget 60% if there's a 30% job
displacement how do they do it I
understand people say hey it'll create
many new opportunities Etc but for the
people who are caught in between this
transition uh it's not great to hear hey
there's going to be many more
opportunities but you're not the one
who's going to get those opportunities
there'll be somebody else what would uh
you know as somebody who's representing
a company who's got a successful
employee base and you're looking at what
has happened your thoughts on this
transformation will this transformation
happen uh with job displacement that's
number one and what should legislators
do about it yeah of course I mean this
is as you mentioned I think you
described the phenomenon very well you
know it's it's not a problem free
development and I think people in the
technology industry sometimes sort of
brushes over uh brush over this this
point and say you know look uh all all
previous sort of innovation Cycles have
had some some uh externalities but
generally speaking we've been better off
now I mean I kind of take both sides of
this argument because I I I am a big
believer in Innovation and I do think
it's very important uh you know I'm
looking at this from from Europe where
we have a a quickly aging population we
have super big challenges with sort of
public finances with with overall
productivity of the economy and an AI
can play a huge part in not necessarily
solving the whole equation but at least
getting us somewhere there and you know
I think you can look at this on an
individual level and be I think
everybody who's used any of these you
know large language modelbased products
out there can see how that has made them
more productive in one way or another
and this is just the very tip of the
iceberg this is just the sort of the
really really early stages so I think
sort of I I take The Optimist view of of
this being basically you know so amazing
of a technology with so much potential
benefit that that we just have to go
down this road we cannot the cost of not
doing it is is even higher uh so so I I
think that's Point number one then point
number two is I think we somehow uh have
a tendency to always get stuck in sort
of we're talking about AI we want to put
everything under the AI policy umbrella
maybe this is in my opinion a little bit
analogous to the point I made about comp
ition policy look you know uh there are
absolutely negative externalities and or
at least the potential of them but I
think that's sort of that's a social
policy that's a labor policy issue we
should absolutely make sure we have
upskilling programs we should absolutely
make sure we have retraining programs
government funded such uh and and we
should absolutely make sure that that
the people be the marketing people or or
whoever else you know that they might
lose their jobs as a result of AI or at
least indirectly that they can they can
have access to retraining I think that's
in everybody's interest um but I I do
want to make the point that has been
made in in a lot of AI conversations
over the last year look I I think in the
short term AI is not going to take your
job or my job but a person using Ai and
being really Adept at using AI might do
that so I I do implore everyone are a
young old you know living anywhere in
the world start using this technology
start playing around with it and learn
of it its potential because it will only
make you more efficient in your
job so according to Patrick AI is not
coming for a job in the immediate but uh
if uh you are using AI you're going to
be more efficient than the one who is
not so better start using Ai No matter
which part of the world you are in or
what job you are doing whether you're
young old whatever you are uh and that's
a great
message Patrick do you think uh the EU
has done it AI act um um UK's got the
whole safety thing us has got over 100
bills in Congress you attended some of
the listening sessions Senator Schumer
has had do you believe that there needs
to be International collaboration in
shaping an AI uh maybe some kind of an
AI regulation around the world and do
you think the Chinese also need to be
involved in this these
discussions yeah I I think this is very
important Point San I mean uh in an
Ideal World I would of course prefer us
to you know all major economies and and
smaller ones as well to to coordinate uh
the rules on on on AI I think you know
harmonized rules would benefit of course
companies be easier to operate in
different regions if you sort of have
one set of rules like we actually do
have in in some areas I think a lot of
Skeptics of multilateralism sometimes
don't realize that that we do have a lot
of international rules pertaining to for
example to to trade um or or even stuff
like like transport that actually uh is
is coordinated on a un level to a large
extent so so I think that's my point
number one I do think there is room for
multilateralism and of course that
benefits everybody from companies to
actually individuals uh as well now it's
likely unrealistic that this will happen
uh at least in the medium term uh that
will have exactly the same rules but the
more we can coordinate the more the
European Union and the US and China and
African countries and South American
countries can coordinate the better it
just will be for everyone involved so
that's why I'm I'm I'm cautiously
optimistic about both the the G20
process the Hiroshima process that was
started last year but also about
initiatives within the UN framework and
the oecd framework looking at sort of
very strategic level Frameworks because
if we can even have similar Frameworks
that already helps companies so when I
for example use or when I look at the
eui Act and the executive order uh from
the Biden Administration I mean there
are clear correlations there
structurally and architecturally they're
very similar uh they end up with
different parameters and different sort
of limitations here and there and
different requirements but structurally
they're very similar so when I create a
compliance plan together with my team
for our company you know yes the the
input in the Excel is a little bit
different in the US and Europe but the
structure actually is pretty much the
same so so I already see benefits of the
fact that I know that the US and the EU
has cooperated on this and I do hope
that whoever gets elected in the US next
fall that that this part of
international collaboration that really
benefits everyone and and doesn't really
cost anything uh is is
continued so uh what Patrick's message
uh to our listeners is international
collaboration is important because it
gives certainty to companies and
entrepreneurs and innovators and he sees
already some level of collaboration
between EU Act and the executive order
and that could also he's hopeful that
other countries other large economies
around the world can collaborate uh
because it would be beneficial for
everybody uh it's not just EU but for
everybody uh Patrick uh your comp is you
know uh plays a very important role in
Europe we have listeners uh from Europe
who are building startups and this is
not about regulation per se but these
are
entrepreneurs uh especially AI related
who are doing mlops Etc what would be uh
just briefly some advice that you would
give to some of the smaller companies uh
developing AI in
Europe thank you I I think this is one
of my favorite topics to talk about
because uh at heart I'm an I'm an
optimist so I I think my number one
message would just be go for it uh this
this you know we we talked about this
earlier but AI is in many way the great
equalizer and and sort of
democratizer uh you know a lot of people
myself I I haven't written code in in 20
years and I'm very bad at it but now for
the last year I've played around with
large language models and I realized
that with the help of some of these
tools I'm actually able to create
software that was something that was not
accessible to me before and I think I'm
not the only one in in this position so
I I think not just to entrepreneurs who
already you know are in the field but to
people I don't know stuck in a job they
might not love a lot or or studying
something that they you know might have
chosen the wrong field you know the
world is is even more your oyster today
than it was two years ago so play around
with de stools let your creativity flow
go out there try fail try again you know
I I I really am big fan of many parts of
the American culture and and one part
that I've always been amazed at is the
entrepreneurial spirit that is evident
not just in in Silicon Valley but around
the country I I've lived in in Cambridge
Massachusetts myself and I've seen the
amazing Innovation that flows around you
know the biotech sector and and other
sectors in that area you know I think
this spirit this culture is something I
wish uh you know more Europeans uh would
sort of try to live um and and I have to
say you know you know my my final point
on this uh topic I actually see a lot
more of that in a younger generation uh
you know we we see such excitement
around for example in Finland the
startup ecosystem here we have an annual
conference called slush in November
really the darkest part of the year and
you know it's 10,000 people come in and
you see all these amazing you know
everything from like a 19-year-old
founder who just you know skipped
college or or or jumped out after the
first semester to like a 60-year-old
person who's worked in a business for 30
years and decided you know what I want
to try my hand at this and and my my
message is go for it take the risk it's
very rarely not worth it and and you
know failure is part of being a human
and part of growing and and I really you
know I'm trying to live that myself as
well so so I I encourage people to go
out there and take more
risks well uh for our listeners in
Europe uh I think Patrick's message is
be like Nike just do it uh that's what
uh Patrick is saying and he's the other
message is uh telling you all is AI is a
big equalizer you don't need to be a
programmer to program uh and if you're
frustrated in a job this is your
opportunity uh and uh the startup
ecosystem uh that he believes uh
embodies us now for the younger
generation in uh Europe can really be
the big this could be the transformative
thing that would unleash uh an
entrepreneur ecosystem Patrick uh
Patrick thank you so much uh I've uh
really enjoyed this conversation learned
a lot about the European ecosystem
learned about some of the things that
Silo is doing your views on regulation
legislation Etc any final words for our
audience on uh on the United States side
you've given them some good pieces of
advice any final uh pieces of advice for
them so you know I don't uh I don't want
to be be arrogant enough to tell people
what to do in the US but maybe a last
word that I can say is you know uh I
I've as as a as a born Natural Born Finn
who liveed most of my life in Finland
but moved to the US two times over
because I enjoyed it so much you know I
just would send a message to Americans
of like you have done so much right uh
and you've been a beacon for for
democracy and free markets around the
world and I I would just implore you
guys to keep being that because I I do
think uh you've played an important role
on the global scene and as someone who's
who you know has a background in both
technology but also in security policy I
do really see that as a as a fundamental
and important role to advance values
that I think both Europe and America
shares like human rights and and you
know democracy and really really
foundational things like this so so I I
do hope uh that you're Innovative Spirit
uh continues uh and I do hope that that
this sort of the global uh productive
role that that that your country has had
ever since World War II uh also
continues so continue be to be the
beacon to the rest of the world uh with
global Innovation uh uh Patrick is uh
your thought process thank you so much
Patrick we've taken a lot of your time
uh really really appreciate it thank you
sanj it's been an absolute pleasure
