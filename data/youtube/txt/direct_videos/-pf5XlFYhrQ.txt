welcome back to the AI policy podcast
I'm Gregory Allen at the wadwani AI
Center at csis today we've got a
conversation with Matt shean who is a
fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace where his research
focuses on AI in China and the US and
particularly the Chinese AI policy
making process I've known Matt for I
don't even know maybe the better part of
seven years now and Matt is the author
of a book about China California ties
called the transpacific uh experiment
and he lived in China from 2010 to 2016
working as a journalist um one thing
that is not widely known about Matt's
work is that he was the key collaborator
in the 2018 smash hit AI superpowers by
Kaiu Lee um Kaiu Lee who's generally
regarded as the most prominent AI
venture capitalist in China uh wrote
something in the acknowledgements that
is not widely known and I kind of just
want this to be more widely known so I'm
gonna I'm going to read it just to give
Matt credit uh that I have always known
he deserves but maybe the rest of the
world needs to know so here's the here's
what kaii said in the acknowledgements
of this book first and foremost I want
to thank my collaborator Matt shean who
did a tremendous amount of work on this
book under a very tight deadline if you
feel this book is fun and easy to read
read or find it rich in information Matt
deserves much of the credit I was lucky
to find a collaborator like Matt someone
with a deep understanding of China the
United States technology and writing so
serious people take Matt shean seriously
and that is true in the United States
and that is true in China where he has
an incredibly diverse and Rich network
of the types of Scholars who are
studying AI policy in China the types of
government officials who are shaping AI
policy in China and that's why we're so
lucky to have you on the podcast today
Matt thank you for coming on thanks a
bunch for having me and for those uh
those kind words um yeah fan of the Pod
happy to be here that's great so um I
just read a little bit about your bio
but I kind of want to understand a
little bit more about your bio so in in
2010 you're a journalist for what Outlet
so in 2010 is when I first moved to
China and I'm not a journalist at first
um I got into journalism about two years
into that time so basically the the sort
of the short version is that
first I was kind of doing all things
China um as a student language student
and then as a journalist covering China
then got into China California stuff
China Silicon Valley stuff and ended up
on China AI stuff starting around 2017
but kind of you know like a lot of we
Jack that's freelance or were you tied
to an outlet or at first it was
freelance then I got a job at the world
post which was this kind of venture
between the Huffington Post and The
bergruin Institute um where they were
trying to essentially like build up The
Huffington Post international coverage
and so I was the first and last ever
correspondent without being posted
trying to you know the journalism
environment there isn't great um about I
mean it was an amazing amazing
opportunity amazing time to be there
this is like essentially the first three
years of she's rise is where I'm
covering and to yeah just be sort of out
in the field like looking at that from a
bunch of angles from a pretty Grassroots
angle overall you know I was just a
whatever 24 fiveyear old kid kind of
running around trying to dig up whatever
stories I could so that was pretty
amazing how do you move how do you make
the transition between being a
journalist which is you know in one
sense research but it's a certain
certain style of research you know
really tied to the what's happening this
day what's happening this week um to the
more policy long form research report
kind of scholar uh that you are now how
did how did that transition happen yeah
it happened in a large part I I I sort
of took some of the journalism with me
uh at least sort of approach your stuff
is more readable than the average Think
Tank report I would say yes thank you
thank you um yeah essentially like
actually when I was uh you know China
doesn't like to give out journalist
Visas so when I was waiting for my
journalist Visa I spent like seven
months back in California in palal where
I grew up and sort of stumbled on all
these really interesting China
California ties China Silicon Valley
ties you know VCS going back and forth
technologists all this stuff and so I
sort of then decided okay I'm going to
I'm going to move move back to
California and I'm going to write a book
about this as kind of like a window into
the future of us China relations well
you're this book came out through Oxford
University press which I normally think
no am I WR not through Oxford no um
through Counterpoint press Counterpoint
press okay so yeah not an academic it's
a trade publisher um but essentially
I I at the time you know like I the US
China technology relationship was just
getting like more interesting more
Dynamic but all the people who were
covering it or analyzing it you know
almost all of them were in DC or in
Beijing and I was like actually
California is kind of like where the
rubber is meeting the road on a lot of
this stuff you know all these Chinese
Venture capitalists getting hooked into
the ecosystem you have all the US
companies trying to like get back into
China or to get into China for the first
time um and just the flow of like people
and money and ideas back and forth so I
kind of just like bounced around the Bay
Area talking to and like building up
these networks of people who kind of you
know were were bouncing between these
two
ecosystems and at first it was yeah it
was almost kind of like reporting it was
like reporting but then just add a layer
of analysis on top of it because you
know just that information wasn't in the
public domain like how and why are
Chinese VCS doing what they're doing
like what uh you know what makes a
Chinese AI scientist who went to
Berkeley and works at Google you know
what makes them decide whether to stay
in the US or to go back to China and so
I kind of took that like reporting
approach and and worked it into you know
essentially an uncovering some new stuff
and adding analysis and then it's really
in the last I don't know five six years
that I've kind of gotten more into maybe
traditional Think Tank work I've gotten
just you know went very very deep on
China's AI regulations and that's really
just kind of like hitting the books you
know hitting the actual regulations
themselves and digging through it so
I've shifted a little bit more into some
of that type of work but you try to
dabble in dabble in everything still try
to get as much information as I can out
of this sort of network of sources and
stuff MH that's that's awesome okay so
we we've talked about your story um and
sort of the the how how it changed over
time now I want you to do the same thing
for the audience on um China's AI
ecosystem from a policy perspective um
so you know whether that's strategic
documents uh industrial policy documents
or regulation which has been the focus
of a lot of your your recent work um
where do you sort of start the Calendar
in in the the China AI policy Journey um
and and how do you tell the story break
it down for our audience sure um I
actually just the other day was looking
at some of the earliest like regulatory
documents that mention Ai and those are
many of them are around 2015 2016
usually it's in the context of they were
really right after alphago right yeah
right after alphao really in the early
days of where they're they're mostly
pumping up their startup ecosystem their
mobile internet ecosystem but they want
to find ways is to hook that into other
Industries and they're like can we have
the mobile internet but powered by AI
can we sort of find ways to adapt it um
if I were to kind of zoom out a little
bit I'd probably break this into like
three big phases of sort of policy and
regulation the first one would go from
about 2017 to 2020 um and this was
really the kind of like go go hype um
pro-development like stimulative era and
this kind of gets kicked off with the
2017 National AI plan which was you know
a very big deal was really shot a lot of
energy and a lot of money into the
Chinese AI ecosystem and you know we
could talk more about how that works but
basically they incentivized like
officials all over the country to say
like whatever whatever your job is if
you're a traffic cop if you're a
university president do something with
AI try to stimulate not just that right
but like when we grade your performance
at the end of the year one of like the
boxes is going to be how good you were
at uh accelerating the adoption of AI or
something like that exactly you know I
mean like the the biggest there's a lot
of differences between our political
systems but one of the biggest ones is
they effectively have a a central HR
department they call the organization
department so every mayor every
University president every sort of
police chief in a small town their
careers are are routing through the
organization department and so when they
sort of send a signal the central
government doesn't like it didn't lay
down some detailed blueprint or say you
know we're going to you know appropriate
$500 billion for AI but they essentially
incentivized everyone around the country
to do that and then that incentivizes
private Capital to kind of flood into
the space and yeah I mean it it really
like revved the engine of uh the Chinese
AI ecosystem which was it was already
developing naturally on its own they
were already you know essentially a
world in the elite ranks globally in a
lot of AI areas and applications and and
you started the story you know in in
2015 2017 and I think it's just worth
pointing out like this is the period
where China's protectionist experiment
with digital Tech has at this point
basically paid off right like Alibaba is
already a real deal in 2015 um BYU a lot
of people complain about it but it's
nevertheless making money in 2015 um
yeah this is at the point where I know
maybe I'm jumping the gun a little bit
but this is what like Mark Zuckerberg
says like hey we get a lot of great
ideas by looking at we what WeChat is
already Ling in China so this is a
moment where Chinese quotequote big Tech
is already real um there's some good
stuff going on in Ai and the government
is saying okay it's our job to quote
unquote like take it to the next level
or something like that exactly and I I
like you putting that historical context
because a lot of people kind of forget
about this era which was It was kind of
my era in China so I'm obviously
invested in the history but you know you
could think of like you were blocking
the US platforms progressively from say
2006 to 2010 but 2010 they kick out
Google that's kind of the last of the
really big platforms and then you have
this period where it's like you know can
Chinese companies like fill the Gap like
are is China going to need to go back to
Google because you can't run a modern
economy without you know access to
Google or is Google going to need to go
back to China because you know it's such
a dynamic and potentially profitable
ecosystem and you know basically the CCP
won that bet and you have it's not just
that big Tech was hitting its stride but
that the startup ecosystem was really
really exploding and you know V tons of
money is flooding into VC this is really
on the boom you know the back of like an
extended economic boom lasting really
decades but you know however far back
you want to take it when you have all
this money from like traditional
Industries that's looking for somewhere
new to go and the government is saying
hey we're pro- Innovation we're pro
startups we are now Pro Ai and a lot of
the money kind of floods into that
because for a lot of private businesses
in China you know one way to to make
money is to try to get in the field that
the government is going to be supporting
get in it early and you know make your
money over the next few years so so in
in 2017 I was having a conversation with
a ethnic Chinese founder but he had
founded his company in Silicon Valley um
but he still had a lot of contacts you
know back in China and he said that the
difference between this is you know in
2017 the difference between AI startups
in China and AI startups in America is
that both AI startups in America and in
China can easily get a ton of venture
capital money it's very easy for them to
both raise a ton of money and do a bunch
of impressive stuff uh but the
difference is that the Chinese companies
also have Revenue you know it's not just
the uh the influx of investment they're
actually making money and he pointed to
uh government as the customer for a lot
of this work um so the best known you
know customer use case but not the only
use case is around the the government
surveillance use case so um you know
companies like sense time which is
really really strong in facial
recognition and all matter of computer
vision um companies like iFly Tech which
is really strong in voice recognition um
the the security forces uh both the
provincial level and at the national
level and the intelligence forces all
really you know look at their annual
report card on what they're going to be
graded in and they get excited by a lot
of this technology there's some really
good reporting that was done by um Josh
Chin and a co-author whose name I can't
remember uh in surveillance St on this
but I'm just curious you know what is
the overlap of this quote unquote go- go
era of 2017 to 2020 um with the rise of
the AI surveillance state in China yeah
it's it's it's very connected um and the
co-author there is Lisa Lynn they're
both they're both great reporters um so
yeah the the government as customer is a
big deal and clearly like yeah the first
example is the facial recognition stuff
at the time you had I think I think
there were four of them they like to
call them you know the four little
dragons or something like that of the
facial recognition startups and yeah I
mean they got hugely inflated valuations
on the back of just sort of building out
that ecosystem and and it extends to
more subtle stuff like iFly Tech as a as
a voice primarily like a voice and
speech um uh you know technology company
AI driven voice and speech technology
company but it also goes pretty far
beyond that in the sense of like you
know courts were uh you know courts were
incentivized judges were incentivized so
they're buying like AI transcription
stuff I'm trying to jam it in there you
know education schools were incentified
so they're trying to find is there some
way we can jam AI into our you know into
our workflow into our classrooms um you
know if you ran an airport you if you
run an airport you're also you know an
official in China and so they're buying
self-driving you know shuttle buses that
will take people from terminal one to
Terminal 2 and so it's pretty pretty
diverse in that way with like the
surveillance stuff obviously being the
most like it's the most immediately
applicable it's the most profitable at
the time a lot of those companies they
sort of you know boomed during like the
buildout and their valuations cooled off
a lot afterward there was this permanent
buildout forever it's like a lot of that
stuff gets finished and doesn't need to
be upgraded for quite a while even
though there's some like annual
maintenance Etc exactly okay yeah so
there's this go- go period and in terms
of policy it's uh pressuring government
use of AI it's uh being a customer for a
lot of this startup
ecosystem um at this stage I think it's
fair to say um there's not much in the
way of Regulation uh would you agree
with that or am I missing something well
this is the era also when they're
starting to put together their personal
information Protection Law data security
law and so essentially the first wave of
AI relevant regulations well the first
wave might be the early internet like
censorship sure regulations but then you
also had all these sort of data
regulations that were coming in and you
know uh I think we have this idea in the
US that of course you know the Communist
Party it surveils its people so there's
no data privacy in China that's not true
you know we have to have kind of a split
brain where it's like the companies are
actually pretty constrained in a lot of
ways and what they do with user data the
government is not constrained okay so
your your mental model is um it's true
that there's no privacy from the
National Security State security
apparatus but there can be substantive
privacy protections apply from the
corporate practices yeah exactly in this
time period are they seeing like like
what what's the proof to what what what
evidence do you find persuasive um that
these regulations aren't for Show are
there like big trials where companies
are paying big fines or or or what do
you look to when you sort of see okay
they're serious about corporate privacy
protection of individual privacy I mean
one thing would just be like talking to
the companies um and they they feel in
many ways kind of boxed in on this um
like they're complaining about it or
something yeah they're complaining about
it um a lot of this emerged out of sort
of scandals involving like data leaks
online I mean you know pre any of this
stuff like the the the data market in
China was was rif and it was rif with
like scammers and so a lot of that stuff
got a ton of attention that's kind of
what drove a lot of this stuff um
there's other things that uh other
examples that popped up over time and
this is kind of getting us into like the
backlash era that starts in 2020 but
let's go there like uh like how does
that how do we transition from the go-
go era to the backlash era so one
example and this is just you know one
little nugget but pretty interesting was
that um alibaba's sort of financial the
arm is ant financial and they run this
thing called Sesame credit and at one
point and I think this is in
2019 The People's Bank of China the
central bank is asking for uh ant
financial and sesame credit to share its
data on like credit scores essentially
for people and uh and financial refused
to share the data which like now when we
look back on it's like wow that's you
know that's bold but in many ways that
was kind of that was the tone of the era
like there that sorry am I do I
understand when you say tone of the era
you mean it was not seen as a bold move
then it was seen as a like cut scen can
say no to the government in the go- go
era it was still seen as bold and when I
look back it looks even more bold but it
was happening like um one sort of bridge
between these eras is uh eventually
they're going to regulate recommendation
algorithms that comes out in 2021 when I
kind of did like the archaeology of that
regulation and Trace back like what
started this regulatory push what
started it is that back in 2016 2017
when uh bite D you know the owner of Tik
Tok their first big app was one called
today's headlines in China too and the
first like big sort of blow up on this
front was that the CCP was saying hey
you have re your recommendation
algorithms are giving people what they
want but really you should be instilling
socialist values and you know promoting
they want you should be giving them what
they need what they need is what we say
they need yeah ex exactly and you can go
back and read this interview with jangi
me the founder um from I think it's late
2016 when he's basically like it's not
my job I'm not trying to instill
anything in people like the algorithm
does what it wants you give people what
they want if they want low culture you
give them low culture if they want High
culture you give them high culture and
it's the thing I'm reading this in like
2022 and I'm shocked at him saying this
but that was a lot of these Founders
were feeling very empowered and it kind
of maybe it hits an apex when like Jack
ma goes out and gives this speech in
which he essentially like criticizes
sort of heckles the financial Regulators
in China for having I think you call it
a pawn shop mentality this is I think
October 2020 and this was really like
the spark that lights the tech crack
down MH um and there's a bunch of
reasons why the tech Crackdown happened
but in a lot of ways I think maybe one
of the main thrusts is a reassertion of
the part reminding all these tech
companies and Founders like the party is
in charge we're we're we're proud of
your success we're grateful for your
hard work but when we say jump you say
how high like then that's how it has to
go exactly and you know there's a bunch
of other inputs like there was a lot of
genuinely like monopolistic
anti-competitive behavior and so they
did a lot of anti uh anti Monopoly
action that was like well warranted and
other things going on but that's kind of
I'd say like the tone of the era the
tone of the tech Crackdown is a reminder
of who's boss and this so maybe take
this era from say 2020 through end of
2022 beginning of 202 it's a little I
mean obviously the tech Crackdown is a
real phenomenon and one of the things it
translates into is depressed investment
it's kind of hard to sort of disentangle
how much of the depressed investment is
zero covid and that you know disastrous
economic policy and how much of the
depressed investment is the te the
Chinese government Tech Crackdown and
then later it'll be tough to you how
much of it as a result of the American
Crackdown on Chinese Tech but overall
it's it's a big shift from the go- go
era we can do anything we're going to
conquer the world to a okay we need to
be quiet we need to be quiet and and
kind sort of keep our heads down kind of
moment yeah yeah and that's you know
this is the era when China is rolling
out its first like algorithm focused AI
focused regulations so they do their one
on recommendation algorithms and deep
synthesis yeah so talk talk about these
specific regulations because as as you
said they sort of are the they're the
correct me if I'm wrong here but like
they're the first time that the
government is making regulations that
not just affect AI like the data law but
are about AI yeah exactly so these
happen in 2021 and
2022 and they the first one is on
recommendation algorithms the second one
is on deep synthesis
which really was their word for
generative AI before we started saying
generative AI yeah um but it was
essentially driven by fears about deep
fakes and so a lot of my work uh in sort
of digging into I'm trying to sort of
build a backend uh a model of the back
end of AI policymaking so how these
regulations came out can we Trace back
like where did these ideas come from how
did they get shaped through you know
sort of the policy ecosystem by ideology
by xiin ping by the bureaucrat see all
this stuff and when I sort of trace it
through these things I should say
they're they're happening in the tech
Crackdown era so they have that kind of
they're happening in an environment
where the government feels like it
doesn't really have to make any
concessions to tech companies so so
whereas previously maybe there would
have still been Tech regulations but it
would have been more of a negotiation
between the government and the private
sector this is just the government
telling the private sector how it's
going to be in large part yeah there's
still some interesting negotiation that
maybe I'll I'll give a flag of that in a
minute um but you know that broadly
these are being rolled out by the
cyberspace administration of China the
CAC which is the online content
regulator they particularly in this
period of time and and even before they
kind of have a reputation of being you
know a hard ass um when dealing with
tech companies and they you know the
recommendation algorithm it comes really
out of this beef that they had with
jangy me over his app where he says it's
not my job they're like it very much is
your job and they did a bunch of initial
they did a bunch of just kind of like
crack Downy things on him they banned
one of his other apps like he had this
sort of successful joke app and they're
just like nope that's gone they threaten
to ban or they paus downloads and
threaten to ban too their original sort
of their original hit app before Tik Tok
and billen um and basically he kind of
like was like okay I get it uh you know
back down and they they did things to
essentially say you know yes we're going
to give people their own feeds but we're
also going to give them a new era feed
where new era was kind of she's
um term that he coined for like his era
basically we're in the new era and like
New Era comes with all this sort of
ideology and this messaging and so they
conceded and they said we're going to
create a new era sort of vertical so
that people could get that but the CC
still wants to put this into into like
formal regulation and so they incubate
that regulation they talk to a bunch of
sort of tech policy people um a lot of
the people who ended up working on AI
policy and China came out of the data
policy World a lot of them are lawyers
who this by the way is like a a very
familiar phenomenon to me I just
remember it when I was in the
dod uh doing AI policy you'd meet all
these people who are like yeah now I'm
an AI policy person and like almost a
100% of them were either a former space
person or a former cyber person you know
like those were the two adjacent
verticals from which you could pivot um
into AI so it's no surprise at all like
the people that you were working with
and meeting in the data privacy era were
now like the AI people yeah exactly and
you know like yeah they cut their teeth
and they did like real legislative work
in that era so they're experienced in
that and they have some you know they
have they have a sense of Technology but
they kind of pivot into this um so they
they do that regulation they do one more
regulation that's on deep fakes um
called Deep
synthesis just a couple things worth
noting you know this was essentially
sparked by like online outcry about
there were some high-profile like face
swapping incidents um where you know
they SWA the faces of two actresses in a
popular TV show and made everyone kind
of debate online and this like got the
attention of The Regulators these are
these are like more or less like
harmless uh uses of AI um they're not
you know revenge porn they're not child
sexual abuse material they're not
politically motivated kind of deep bakes
but nevertheless they show the Chinese
Community the art of the possible and
where this technology might be headed um
and that's enough to spark regulatory
movement is that fair to say yeah I'd
say this is the spark a lot of it gets
filtered through you know they pay very
close attention to International AI
policy debates um and so when I actually
when I was kind of looking back the
earliest like State media articles
talking about deep fakes almost every
one of them has some reference to either
an American AI lab or an American news
article like one of them references a
report from the Carnegie endowment which
made me happy one of them references
when uh I think uh Jordan Peele did sort
of a an Obama pseudo deep fake that went
up on BuzzFeed and they're like
referencing this you know viral Jordan
Peel Obama video in in like serious not
the final regulatory document but in all
the debates beforehand that's
interesting they're kind of yeah they're
taking like the the the sparked it's
sparked by something going in their
ecosystem they're taking in the
international debates and then they're
filtering it through their own
ideological prism their own
bureaucracy and maybe I'll just flag one
more thing that's interesting just on
the company front um for a long time
this regulation that ended up being the
Deep synthesis regulation it was called
The Deep fake regulation M um and
essentially tensent you know one of the
biggest the the creator of WeChat the a
big entertainment platform video game uh
you know one of the largest video game
uh distributors in the world creators
Distributors and tensent kind of got the
feeling like actually we don't really
like this we don't like all this talk
about deep fakes because really this
technology is much broader and it can be
used in all these creative ways that are
economically enhancing and so they their
sort of policy Think Tank introduced
this term deep synthesis to say like
that's actually a more appropriate term
not everything's a deep fake we're
really actually synthesizing you know
all this data and generating new stuff
and so they essentially did this kind of
like thought leadership campaign where
they pushed this term deep synthesis it
works in China too I guess exactly yeah
and it you know it just it went directly
into the regulation like we can't point
the exact moment or the mechanism where
that happened but I'd say that's
something that I'm pretty confident in
um saying so it's it's a it's a tough
era for the tech companies but they're
still able to kind of work their angles
yeah and I think I think it's also just
worth saying um about the tech backlash
era um is that Chinese AI research is
still really good you know so if you go
to nerps if you go to you know the big
computer vision conferences the big
other AI conferences Chinese researchers
from Chinese universities are there
Chinese researchers from Chinese
companies are there and they're
publishing good papers that are getting
the recognition of their peers in the
international world and even in the tech
backlash era um this is continuing to be
the case so it's sort of like it's not
like you had this Tech backlash and all
these this this generation of AI
researchers that are coming up go from
smart to dumb like no they're still
doing good work um the corporate side of
the equation is a little bit more
complicated but the the researchy side
of the equation is continuing more or
less uninterrupted yeah absolutely and
you know especially like if it's
academic research on that side um yeah I
mean their their sort of share of
Publications in the top conferences just
kept on ticking up and it you know it's
yeah it became a really really rich
sophisticated ecosystem Okay so we've
got we've got the go go era we've got
the backlash era when in your in your
sort of taxonomy here when does the
backlash era end and and what is the
name of this third era that we're in and
now
yeah the so I'd say the the change
happens essentially in the spring of
2023 MH and it's it's I was thinking I
was trying to come up with some name to
like pin down this era but it's it's a
little bit uh it's a little bit mixed
I'd say from mid 2023 until now they've
they've eased up on the regulatory side
a lot they've gotten much more into
embracing AI once again and saying yeah
let's let's use this to power our
economy and stuff like that but it's
it's taken time and it's been an
evolution they had to you know the big
the big sort of bombshell in here is
that the end of 2022 chat GPT drops and
two there's two Bombshells at the end of
2022 right there's uh the chat GPT
bombshell which is whoo um generative AI
uh the capabilities are not just super
duper impressive but there's clearly a
massive commercial opportunity there's
this major capture of global mind share
around generative AI that comes from the
chat GPT moment um and China is by no
means oblivious to that and then the the
second bombshell is around us export
controls because you know the United
States had already done export controls
on uh China that had really um you know
captured the attention of xiin ping and
other top Chinese leaders in the in the
first Trump Administration um but those
were geared at either law enforcement
activities or the Telecommunications
sector this is the first time where the
Biden Administration says actually the
thing that we care the most about in
these export controls is artificial
intelligence um and and you know I've
written about this you've written about
this but the way I sort of say it's like
from the United States perspective they
were willing to overturn 20 years of
trade and Technology precedent with
China in order to do this this new
export control policy and the
justification America gave for it was AI
is worth it it's that strategically
important that we overturn you know this
this this trading relationship as it
exists not that that was only reason but
nevertheless it was the stated reason
and so China of course has to react to
that move um by the United States and
also sort of say wait if the Americans
think it's this important maybe we
should you know uh uh you know second
guess our own assessment of how
important this is yeah yeah I mean and
end of 2022
was I think somewhat traumatic um in in
China this is when you're saying there's
another bomb shot I like well which one
because it's also the it's the breakdown
of zero covid is happening almost
exactly when chat GPT is dropping it's
also like the beginning of the major
downturn in the economy essentially held
on to zero covid until the end of 2022
the economic costs are starting to mount
but they really sort of uh you really
feel it in China in end of 2022
beginning of 2023 and it's just forcing
like the CCP to I think re-evaluate The
Stance they've had for the last few
years it kind of shook their confidence
in different ways I'm just I'm just
going to throw some terms out here to
help us this era but it's like the uh
The Fortress economy era I've heard that
one before the counter containment era
I've heard that one before um and the uh
the AI race era I've heard that one uh
before like it wasn't a quote unquote
race uh but the combination of the
export controls chat GPT you know etc
etc you know made it okay it's this is a
race and we're racing but I'm I'm open
to your thoughts as so what we yeah I uh
I hadn't gone to the sort of counter
containment side of things but yeah in
many ways that's accurate I think the
the big thing is that we we tend to
underestimate in the US I think I even
underestimated until recently is just
how much the economy was like Weighing
on this decision-making process they you
know they were seeing the economy in the
dumps they were seeing Private Business
sentiment so low and they were uh
realizing that maybe when we thought
that there was essentially no cost
either to our Tech capabilities or to
our economy me to like we could beat up
these you know these Founders and
entrepreneurs we could sort of depress
like business sentiment with no cost
we're still at the Forefront of AI and
we still have a booming economy
something I heard from a a contact AI
policy contact in Beijing who said you
know right before chpd came out if you
had asked the CCP leadership like where
do you think the two countries stand in
AI they would have said you know I think
pretty much the same you know maybe
we're even a little ahead you know who
knows maybe we're ahead in some areas
and chat GPT really like forced a
reevaluation of that and so they're
simultaneously like they're worried
about the Gap with the US they're
worried about the economy and realizing
you you essentially you can't just do
whatever you want to private compan and
pay no costs yeah and so we essentially
we see the the pivot coming in AI policy
where in the spring in uh I think it was
April 12th of 2023 the the CAC the
content regulator released the draft
generative AI regulation and it was
incredibly strict like if that
regulation had gone into effect as is it
would have largely like crushed the
generative AI industry in China it was
everything that the model puts out must
be true and accurate everything all of
the training data must be true and
accurate so like hallucination banned
straight up you know you know of course
they can always like fudge around the
edges with this but like the signal that
was sent from that and you know what
could be the sort of practical impact
was was really severe and harsh right
and then basically over the spring you
watch you know the the AI policy
community over there debate this and
push back on this and the companies push
back on this BYU and other companies
that see their future in this saying hey
you know this is going to crush this is
going to crush our industry and we need
to keep up with America we need to
revitalize our economy all of these
unlike unlike when Jack ma talks back
and gets slapped down this time the push
back is basically works right it works
yeah and it's s you know it's subtle
it's not Jack ma it was bold to go up
there and just like challenge you know
head challenge something it's something
different like a lot of what was
happening was by do was like you know
sponsoring workshops with like the
leading AI policy you know figures where
we're all going to sit down and talk
about how can we really improve this
wonderful really good regulation you
have here but maybe we could just tweak
it around the edges yeah with some
fabulous or deres and at it why not um
and yeah we saw like it worked you know
they they very clearly like they made
changes directly that were suggested by
some of these people they toned down the
requirements a bunch they said
essentially doesn't have to be true and
accurate but you have to take effective
measures to increase the truth and
accuracy they really like ease off it in
a lot of ways and that that's what
starts this New Era where they're going
to be more accommodating it's still I I
have to emphasize that like despite them
easing up on the companies I think it's
still the most sort of compliance
burdened ecosystem in the world like the
things that they have to do things that
they're AI companies yeah you know maybe
when the AI act goes into full effect
and depending on how they implement it
it could be more intensive but what you
know essentially the Chinese system is
uh through their early regulations in
generative AI they set up this algorithm
registry or model registry where you
have to do all these predeployment tests
you have to ask the model 2,000
questions about politics and it needs to
give the correct answer you know 90% of
the time you have to so this is you know
either you don't talk about Xi Jinping
or you point out that he's the greatest
leader of all time boy oh boy we love
Shish ping you know like these are 2,000
questions uh basically political
ideology Conformity political ideology
they include a lot of the things that we
you know talk about uh gender bias and
race bias and even they've started to
hint at some of the concerns around like
kmo and stuff like that not in The
Binding way but hint that not at this
time frame not in the 2023 era right uh
that comes in 2024 and essentially
they're they're rolling out these um
they call them technical documents but
essentially technical standards
compliance standards for what you need
to do to be in compliance with the
regulation and they you know they they
prescribed these kind of these tests
that they have to do and so like yes
easier than before and from talking to
companies they're like yeah I mean you
know the CAC now is like Hey we're your
friend we want to help you comply and
that's why we're going to like help
Usher through this process so it's a big
change there there's like it's not the
go go era it's not the backlash era it's
somewhere in the middle where where the
the government is committed to doing
what it takes to support the a ecosystem
but it's not willing to you know just
give a Long Leash when it comes to
ideology and while it is amenable to
feedback on regulation it is not going
to abandon the regulation and yeah I
mean they're never going to abandon the
idea that like they're never going to
abandon censorship requirements they're
never going to abandon my focus and
ideology that's always top of mind but
it's also like just technically like
models were getting better at this you
know their the hallucinations are going
down they're figuring out and the CCP
also kind of realized it's actually
maybe not the biggest deal in the world
if like one time the model says to one
person something naughty it's not you
know their their mindset is the social
media era that's like broadcast and
viral go viral and be seen by hundreds
of millions of people it's a different
animal right when there's hundreds of
millions of conversations but every
single one of them is unique kind of
thing exactly exactly and so yeah
they're they're they essentially are
like feeling their way through this
turning towards a more positive
pro-development agenda I think like
right now you know I hate to divide up
too many eras but I think late 2024 into
now we're kind of entering a I was GNA I
was literally about to ask this are we
in the Deep seek era right is like what
how do we think about this moment yeah
it's it's partly the Deep seek era it's
partly the again it's the go- go like AI
for economic growth AI for productivity
era like they're always they just the
CCP generally doesn't think that like
entertainment is important they don't
think that like consumer they they don't
like consumer stuff of course they want
to increase consumption but they're not
interested in like fun apps they're
interested in like what can this
technology do for my sort of economic
political goals yeah and you know they
see an economy that's it's in trouble
it's you know can they jump over the
middle- income trap can they survive in
this new era of sort of you know uh
technology access and so they're even
before deep seek they're really pushing
this idea of like you need to integrate
AI into traditional Industries that's
their big push if you see that in ways
that are
like counterproductive I mean I I think
about for example I spend a lot of time
thinking about the semiconductors part
of this story and it is definitely the
case that like all the Chinese local
governments are being like great news
you're going to buy a lot of Huawei
chips whether or not you can figure out
how to use them whether or not they're
any good Thou shalt you know buy Huawei
chips and so you have a bunch of data
centers in China that seem you know
impressive but actually like the
utilization is incredibly low but um
there's something that I want to ask you
about which I think is super interesting
is after the the Deep seek moment um
there's that meeting of course uh where
um the CEO of deep seek is invited to to
join a bunch of other Tech Executives
and meet with shiin ping which I want to
talk with you about but I want to skip
ahead for one second which is um the the
organization in China whose name and
acronym escapes me at the moment the one
that oversees all the state Ed
Enterprises said says I don't care how
or you know why but Thou shalt find a
way to use deep seek in your daily
operations you know as soon as possible
and so that's sort of a um it's a return
to one of the tools of the goo era which
is the government and state own
Enterprises as anchor customers for
seeding an AI private sector ecosystem
that can hopefully reach meaningful
economies of scale and that does seem to
be something that they've sort of
hearkened back to um in the wake of the
deep seek moment and and that meeting um
I'm I'm curious you know what your think
is there yeah it's very interesting and
it it is and when anyways it's flashing
me back to 20156 with the mobile
internet 2017 with the national AI plan
and the the thing is like they have the
intent and they want to go back to this
toolkit that has served them very well
in the past but my question is like do
they have the money and do they have the
the resources not just does the
government have the money but can it
stimulate private Enterprise and private
investment in the way that it used to
and so like with 2017 AI plan yes
government as a big customer government
as a kind of just a stimulant throughout
but a lot of that relies on them revving
up the private sector revving up private
investors and right now like the
economic situation in China there's
diverging takes on it but broadly not
good local governments have a lot of
debt varies a lot from Province to
Province but a lot of debt but wait you
know I literally just saw Kaiu Lee on
CNBC he says you know deep sea change is
everything venture capital is back in
China is he just you know selling his
Market because that's you know directly
tied to his his personal fortunes or or
what is he getting out there that that
is true or not true I think it can be
partly true and you know uh from his
perspective he's running a business and
like that uh it might be particularly
true for his business in this case
they're seeing sort of an infusion of
things but I was in Shanghai let's say I
was in Shanghai last July and kind of
talking to some entrepreneurs there and
at that time so this is pre deep seek
but I was like you know yeah what's
what's the funding ecosystem like like
what's the you know how's how's raising
money going these days and they
basically like you know the VC ecosystem
is a shell of itself like a lot of the
places have just you know closed up or
they're just being very cautious and
very not investing very much you know
government is government especially
local governments that are kind of doing
VC on the side or s soes that are doing
you know VC on the side they are
proclaiming themselves to be willing but
you don't want to take their money if
you can avoid it because it come it
comes with like and by the way you
should definitely hire my cousin as a
consultant or something like that and
even I mean even to the level of like uh
if your startup fails you might be
worried about going to jail you know
that's like a quite extreme case and
this is
not alone from the Russian mob uh like
you will pay this Back le yeah it's it's
not seen as a VC investment it's seen in
many yeah as a loan in some cases so
that's you know there are uh like the
Chinese government has shown itself at
times to Be an Effective like
distributor of capital um even if not
efficient you know effective but
companies generally want to avoid it if
they can and so now we're in this moment
where they're kind of firing up all the
old engines um you know using all the
old Tools in a way with it's like is the
you know is the gas tank full enough and
is the government gas tank funding tank
full enough and also is the like is is
private sector going to come along um
you know so we' uh we we've now broken
up uh the history of AI policy in China
into four eras of which two definitely
have a name uh and two you know are are
in the progress of being named maybe you
know we'll look forward to your next
paper uh to do this now I want to shift
gears a little bit and um Talk a little
bit about who's who in the zoo of the
Chinese AI policy ecosystem so you know
some of our uh our audience could could
give this talk because they're such
experts in AI policy but some of our
audience you know specializes in other
areas of AI so for for you know at a at
a entrylevel friendly uh way talk about
who who matters in China's AI policy
ecosystem institutionally and to the
extent it's relevant
individually so yeah there's kind of
like the bureaucratic government side
and there's like the broader AI policy
ecosystem side M maybe
for I I'll give a couple thoughts on
like the AI policy ecosystem but I won't
that can get quite in the weeds and then
I'll just give an overview of like the
bureaucratic actors that are the most
important um I guess the first thing I'd
say is just that like the AI policy
ecosystem over there is very rich and
very sophisticated um you know they in a
lot of ways are the mirror image of our
system like you know funh housee mirror
because it has to fit into a CCP system
system in the end but you know when I
talk to people over there often they're
I'd say over there like University
professors and academics are just much
more influential than they are here so a
lot of the most influential like AI
policy people are professors um to name
a few there's a woman named jungling Han
um who she's on the UN high level
advisory body she you know advises uh
different Ministries as they're doing AI
stuff and just very prolific writer um
there's sort of think tanks over there
chinua is always in the mix in a bunch
of ways on this um but yeah it's it's
it's interesting is it feels so alien
and foreign over there and then
sometimes when you sit down with them
you're like so I'm trying to analyze the
Chinese policy ecosystem to help America
understand that and you are trying to
analyze the American AI ecosystem to get
ideas that you can feed into the Chinese
system and so it's it's a it's
interesting and it's fun to kind of get
in the weeds of that if we go to the
actual like uh governmental party and
government side of things I'll just give
like a couple of the key actors I mean
the the the the actor that drove all of
the early stuff that really kicked all
this off and that runs that sort of
registration and testing and stuff like
that is the cyberspace administration of
China the CAC they are the first author
on all three of China's leading AI
regulations
um and they maybe if we go back like two
years we'd say like yeah they are
essentially the they they are the whole
show or like they are so clearly the
leader but a lot of what we've seen over
the past two years year and a half is
them perhaps being a little bit on their
back foot you know they are a Content
regulator and they are a control focused
organization that's their bread and
butter and so as we transition into this
new like actually let's encourage
development let's stimulate it's it's
shifted the balance in some ways there's
CAC is still super important and
probably the most important but another
organization that's that's sort of risen
in this moment is the National
development and Reform Commission the
ndrc which is essentially China's sort
of macroeconomic policy house um they
were not a signatory of the early AI
regulations the way it works is
essentially like one Ministry is like
the lead author and then other
Ministries co-sign they weren't on the
first two regulations at all but when
the generative AI regulation came out
they were the second leading author on
that and essentially the what's happened
is they have been in a lot of ways
empowered to be a a bit of a coordinator
and a balancer on AI policy we're not
just going to let the sort of ideology
people in namely the CAC like run the
whole show they're good at things we
want to keep them empowered we want them
to do stuff but we do need someone to
balance that out a little bit and so the
ndrc has taken on a more important role
in that way and if you were to like uh
I'm oversimplifying massively here right
but if you were to think about like the
criteria that these organizations are
optimizing for is it fair to say that
the you know the CAC is optimizing for
sort of political content security type
criteria and the ndrc is optimizing for
more economic industrial policy type
goals is that too simplified missing
something no broadly that's true there's
other there's other Ministries that are
involved in that the miit the ministry
of industry and information technology
is also a big kind of industrial policy
booster and they're they're key here and
and also the CAC does a lot of cyber
security stuff not purely not all
content focused but also cyber security
so they're in the mix there um so you
have these two organizations I'll just
maybe name like one more there a lot I'm
currently building a giant map that
can't wa for map to come out I'm a
sucker for org chart uh yeah it's fun
actually um the other thing I would just
flag is the uh newly created as of 2023
CCP Science and Technology commission
and so commissions a party entity not a
civil government uh entity
correct um and they you know they are
essentially the party entity that's
that's charged with guiding uh China's
technological breakthroughs with maybe
an extra focus on like breaking through
the US choke holds um and what's
interesting is they they were created
and then the ministry of science and
technology which is a government entity
was essentially turned into the office
of the CCP S&T commission so a lot of
this stuff gets Blended where the part
is you know part is ultimately in charge
they've got now the ministry of science
technology kind of working for them
people like the party was always
ultimately in charge but now we want to
be more closely in charge yeah exactly
exactly and like they some people have
compared now Ministry of science
technology maybe it's a little bit like
the like OSP office of science
technology policy in the US it's like
it's there to generate ideas and to
maybe kind of like um direct some uh
make some bets in terms of like large
projects that we should go in on um but
it's it's sort of operating under the
ccps andt commission so you have kind of
like their in some ways maybe the most
pure Innovation Innovation and science
for science's sake or for you know
National Power sake ndrc is more uh AI
Innovation for economic growth and the
CAC is kind of the uh you know the the
content and ideology focused with a
little bit of cyber security so one more
organization that you haven't mentioned
and it's a perfect segue in to our next
topic um which is AI safety in China so
the United States has created the AI
safety Institute um there's this
International network of AI safety
institutes um the UK has the AI security
Institute all of this is sort of
descended from the UK AI safety Summit
in November 2023 um and China did not
have an entity that was a peer
institution to all of this um but just
recently uh just you know co uh
coincident with the Paris AI action
Summit um there is this thing in China
that is not an AI safety Institute but
it's also not not an AI safety Institute
it's a as you said it's a funhouse
mirror kind of reflection of an AI
safety Institute so talk to us about
like how this institution came to be
what it is and what it's going to do
maybe what what it's already done sure
thing so the institution is called the
China AI safety and development
association association and okay they
you know in their announcement which was
at Paris they said like this is the
Chinese equivalent to the US AC and the
ukac and first I'll give kind of like
the Topline takeaway and then we can
kind of go through the history a little
bit the Topline takeaway is that they
this is run by people who are interested
in AI safety and who have been kind of
like talking about that publicly for a
while MH but it was created and sort of
empowered in like you know tapped by the
government because they wanted to make
sure China was represented at
International fora China has very
intense uh fomo about International
governance things they're always
believing sometimes for good reason that
the US is trying to exclude China that
China doesn't have a seat at the table
that China isn't getting its due respect
and so when the US created the AC and
specifically created the network of AC's
and said we're going to have a meeting
in San Francisco in November 202 four
where we get these AC's together that
helped as an impetus to this group of
sort of AI safety focused people and
trying to say hey we need one of these
two we need an AC uh or an aish thing be
represented this is so funny to just say
out loud right but like if there's going
to be a meeting then we need to build an
organization so that it can attend the
meeting I mean that's overstated it but
it's kind of funny yeah yeah I mean
that's it's it's a little bit of like
the the group of people who found this
and I'll shout out some individual
people Andrew Yao touring Award winner
probably the most respected computer
scientist in China spent decades in the
US um he is sort of one of the leading
figures a guy named Shan who is um a
Dean at chingua uh educated at Carnegie
melon in the US has been one of the most
think he's lectured the poit bureau as
many times as anyone else yeah and he WR
he wrote for a while the China AI
development index um which is sort of
the most comprehensive report on China's
overall AI ecosystem soup nuts and and
he's also mentored a lot of the AI
policy community of China right yeah so
it's like Andrew ya is the kind of like
uh esteemed uh you know uh I was trying
to I was te Godfather yeah technical
Godfather Shan is in many ways kind of
like the policy equivalent of that
they're two of the key people and that
it um Loops in others and these are
people who have yeah they were
participating in like International
dialogues on AI safety they've they've
signed a lot of the letters warning
about catastrophic risks and stuff like
that so you have them and and a couple
other figures that essentially are kind
of like policy entrepreneurs in China so
they kind of put these things together
like we care about AI safety we're
interested in this uh there's going to
be this meeting and the Chinese
government doesn't like to be left out
so like hey you know Empower us tap us
as your representatives um to make sure
that we uh you know are represented at
China and here I think
I kind of have to insert myself into the
story because you know my perspective
for a long time had been you know having
gone to China having met with Schon and
zingi and some of the other sort of um
leading lights of AI safety and AI
policy in China um and then going into
the dod and trying to have an actual AI
safety conversation you know between the
dod and Pla and and being rebuffed in
that and there was also you know that
was something that the pla had called
for in a New York Times oped so I was
like hey there's this big big disconnect
between what's going on in the academic
ecosystem and what's going on in the
government ecosystem obviously mil
military uh is its own thing but again
you know a one-star uh Commander In The
People's Liberation Army had said in the
new in the New York Times Like This is a
thing that our military should talk
about so um we kind of felt rebuffed I
was sort of frustrated then you had the
Biden Administration um and I was not in
the B Administration I was a civil
servant but I had already left
government by this point they Tred to
have this AI safety dialogue uh with
China um they felt like the Chinese
participation was sort of not
equivalently substantive it was sort of
difficult to have the quality and
caliber of the conversation that they
wanted to have I think it's fair to say
of of the Biden administrations take
away from that um and so you know there
was sort of this sense of okay like is
it the case that uh these very respected
academics in China like the the head
honchos don't actually care what they
think at least in the case of AI safety
and uh that was my talking point for a
long time but now you at least have this
sort of like institutional bestowment of
No in fact those guys they're the guys
um and and here is this thing that
they're in charge of and so um it really
is sort of a elevation of them and their
work so that it's not just the domestic
uh kind of environment but also like um
embracing these Concepts like AI safety
uh which I think it's worth saying
you're you know you're the Chinese
linguist of course here but it's worth
pointing out that Safety and Security
are the same word in Chinese um so uh
the the sort of name change that the UK
AI safety Institute just did doesn't
apply to that don't don't you don't have
to change the name in Chinese safety
exactly so um you know H how how do you
sort of sense the the importance of this
institution obviously it's early um but
you know what is it done and and how
will we know if this is like a press
release kind of an organization that
exists to look good versus how will we
know if this is like a substantive
organization that is actually driving
policy
decisions yeah this is the millionar I
suppose yeah and I think the the sort of
Topline takeaway would be that like
right now it is not substantively it is
not substantively important in China in
that it's not it as an organization is
not very solid it's a really what it is
Association right it's an association
the correct translation like it's not
like they're secretly this incredibly
important actually in Chinese it's
called a network but they realized that
they couldn't say Network in English
because then you have AC networks and
the Chinese AI safety Network um but
yeah no head honcho it's run by a
committee I mean among other things it's
run by a committee it's I think that
stuff is pretty fluid it's clear like
what the sort of handful of people are
who are at the top and what I would say
is yeah like right now they don't have
uh they are not running uh as an
institution like uh safety evaluations
on Frontier models that's like the bread
and butter of what the US and the ukac
are supposed to be doing which requires
a certain degree of like technical
capacity that I would say to the extent
anyone in China has that technical
capacity it's at
cic yes there so in the in the in the
network there are some testing and
evaluation focused organizations so
there's a uh sort of a think tank a
technical Think Tank under miit the
ministry of industry and information
technology this technical think tank is
part of it the shangai AI lab is part of
it Cher Institute with is which is
Andrew Yao's um sort of research lab are
part of it and all of these groups they
do run some technical evaluations on AI
um they they started off in the much
more you know traditional content
security type of evaluations they've
started to incorporate some that we
would call more like safety focused
whether it's bio risks or stuff like
that say that ecosystem is very immature
and as as it is in many places and um
the question for me is essentially like
this group this Association it gets
political capital from getting China a
seat at the table like when they go out
and represent China that builds
political capital for them domestically
oh that's kind of weird so it's a little
bit of a Chicken and the Egg thing
because you could sort of say like look
if you're not a real or organization
that actually matters in China why would
we invite you to our meeting and their
rebuttal is like no one in China will
let us be a real organization until you
invite us to the meeting yeah this is
where I think that um some like
basically smart diplomacy um could do a
lot could do a lot of good um where
because I mean just to just to like put
yourself in the in the hands of in the
in the situation like a US Diplomat for
example you don't want to talk to
China's marketing department about AI
safety you want to talk to China's you
know like people who matter in AI policy
about AI safety um and that's kind of
the question they're going to be asking
themselves I'm sure the UK and the other
members of the international AI safety
Network are sort of asking themselves is
um there's there's real risks right to
diplomatic political um of quote unquote
you know like bringing China in and if
you're just talking to the marketing
department like all cost benefit um but
I think your point about you know how
that how that interacts intersects with
the existing ecosystem can I ask just
one this is just I'm entirely
speculating I have no evidence of any of
this does the CAC and the ndrc do they
hate this new organization do they wish
it would go away that all of its
responsibilities would be divided up
amongst
them uh so I can't speak to their like
emotional state but and this is
interesting the organization will say
formally it does not list any formal
government linkage or affiliation they
they simultaneously say we are the
Chinese AC and we represent China
internationally but they also won't say
anything about like where do we fit into
the government this Quantum superos of
being the government not the government
yeah you know the USAC is in the
Commerce department when I talked to
people in we were we were both in Paris
I got a chance to talk to a lot of the
sort of people involved in this on the
Chinese side and in off- the record
conversations some of them will say
we're we're on background you can't say
it if it's off the Record uh on
background we're effectively under the
ndrc we're effectively linked to the
ndrc and what happened and I was kind of
following this last year was all behind
closed doors but trying to keep tabs on
it essentially the different
organizations in China different
bureaucratic uh Ministries and like the
CAC were competing we offering competing
proposals to say you should make this AC
under us so the the CAC is like hey
here's our proposal we should be the
home of the AC and DRC is saying this I
think probably Ministry of science
technology doing the same thing and what
appears to have happened is that the
ndrc sort of won that um won that
competition MH still pretty unclear like
what is the relationship there how
strong is it would this ever go in house
right because like all of the quote
unquote Safety and Security stuff that
had been coming out of China was very
like content security AKA political
ideology kind of security which was like
one of the reasons that made it hard to
sort of embrace it right as a as a
diplomat outside of China um so the fact
that it's not in the content security
organization um is kind of interesting
like it doesn't
guarantee uh that the work that comes
out of this place is is going to be of
the vein you know where they can have
the kind of conversation that um at
least during the Biden Administration
diplomats were interested in having um
but it's it's an interesting choice it
is thing I the way that I think how Rock
Solid is that though I mean like it's
not like they're on the orc chart uh not
on the orc chart some people will say no
no no no ties some people say yeah
that's what it is um I think this is
going to stay amorphous for a little
while in some ways uh they were kind of
you know they were working to roll this
thing out for a while they wanted to
roll it out before the AC uh Network
meeting in San Francisco effectively
that didn't happen there a lot probably
due to these kind of bureaucratic
politics who gets to own it yeah um so
an an incredible time in AI policy in
China I mean you've been following it
for the better part of a decade now it's
been interesting every year uh for that
decade um but what are you what are you
interested in for 2025 what are you like
looking on and uh to the extent that
you're willing to share with the
audience you know what papers do you
have coming up soon they should be on
the lookout and excited to read in the
future sure um yeah in terms of papers I
have one paper that's distinctively a
lot of our conversation for the last
hour I'm trying to put it in in paper
form this is actually pretty helpful for
that this is the marketing document for
that this is the marketing document
exactly so that I'm hoping will be
coming out in you know a month or or so
um what I'm kind of looking at is
essentially like they part of this
switch from the sort of Crackdown era to
the more um uh pro-development era is
that they they kind of put the breaks on
a lot of uh policy regulatory policy
they were talking about hey maybe we're
going to release a national AI law and
you had SC putting out their proposal
like this is what we think a national AI
law should sound like and it's
interesting to read those but
effectively the word is like that that's
not happening any time soon it maybe you
know originally maybe it would have
happened in 25 26 27 that is now sort of
on the back burner so in a lot of ways
like the the regulatory policy stuff and
the legal policy stuff is very much on
the back burner for the time being so a
lot of what I'm looking at is maybe the
two sides of it there's like the
development side and then there's this
sort of safety side the development side
is I'm I'm very interested in yeah can
this toolkit this like industrial policy
toolkit that they used in the past does
it still work as effectively in this
present moment um they said there they
Ann announced this1 trillion doll one
sorry one trillion R&B so like 140
billion US Dollars um VC fund for AI
That's going to have a longtime Horizon
20-year time Horizon very patient
Capital um but then you say like so
where's the money coming from and they
say oh local governments and private
sector and it's like those are the two
people that aren't generally trying to
invest very much so a lot of my
questions are around that like does this
toolkit work can they sort of rev it
back up in the way that they want to
well I mean you know just at least in
the semiconductor world the the rule of
thumb was that you know if you've got
like a government guidance fund take the
headline number and divide it by three
but that that divide by three will
really happen um you know and and when
you start with a trillion R&B divided by
three you're still in pretty big money
yeah yeah and so I think that's a it's a
big open question that I'm I'm going to
keep following I think on the safety
side of things in a lot of ways I'm not
banking on like this institution the
China AI safety and Development
Association like suddenly getting like
binding legal pre-employment testing
powers and it's just going to like force
everybody into line and suddenly they're
going to be all in on catastrophic risks
or the government is going to be all in
on catastrophic risk what I'm looking at
and what one of my colleagues Scott
singer who I work on a lot of the stuff
with is trying get a better sense of
these testing and evaluation
organizations in China like Shanghai AI
lab like
cic um ba AI that just got put on The
Entity list um these are some of the
groups that are doing some of the
relevant maybe maybe we say the most
important but at least policy relevant
um evaluations work and it's like do
those evaluations get more sophisticated
do those what do those evaluations focus
on and is there ever a do we see any
chance that that work gets in some way
embedded into like uh binding policy and
stuff like that so those are kind of a
little bit of my two focuses uh amazing
um well uh we're all looking forward to
your your big paper dropping in a month
where we will learn you know the the two
names of the final eras of Chinese AI
policy um but Matt shean uh you know
I've always admired your work uh even
when I don't agree with your work I
always find it essential to read and I
always learn a ton from it um and so I'm
I'm really glad you took the time to
