hello I'm Tom Parker and welcome to
voices from the seps ideas lab in this
episode I spoke to Ava Midel AA is a
Bulgarian politician and has been a
member of the European Parliament since
2014 she is a key figure in the eu's
digital policy championing technological
growth and the digitization of Europe
during our interview we discussed
Europe's role in shaping Global AI
standards the balance between regulation
and Innovation and how the EU can bridge
the gap between emerging Technologies
and economic growth I hope you enjoy the
episode hi AA thank you very much for
coming to Fe to me thanks for having me
so AA what are your thoughts on the
global perception of the eu's approach
to Tech well eu's approach to Tech is an
approach based on values on
trustworthiness um on accountability on
transparency what the European Union
does when it puts some sort of
guardrails and boundaries to what
technology can do or cannot do what it
has in mind is the protection and the of
the citizen and securing its safety
which ultimately would lead to more
trust in a given technology I think we
haven't been very good in explaining
that because a lot of the narrative has
been revolving around the EU just wants
to find companies and it targets
specific companies um I think the answer
lies in the European way of life we have
developed
our Societies in a way that citizens
feel protected they feel that the
institutions put the Citizens first um
well in the same time I would like to
hope that we also prioritize investment
simplification and making sure that
Europe is open for business but in a
European way what role does digital
Innovation play in boosting Europe's
competitiveness and
economy Innovation just isolated by its
own wouldn't necessarily Ben benefit
European competitiveness it's about how
do you apply those Innovations how do
you make sure that the newest
Technologies are implemented in our
traditional Industries for example where
Europe's strengths lies so I think the
way we should look at Innovation is how
do we connect the startups the scale-ups
um invest in them make sure they have
purpose to solve complex issues and
problems and most importantly comp
connect them with the already existing
existing companies whether in
manufacturing or in any other field
where Europe has its strength um to yeah
multiply those strengths um I like to
refer to the light bulb and electricity
and the reason why I do this is because
if we do not apply AI in our traditional
businesses today we'll still be running
on Manpower and gas lamps while the rest
are having light bulbs and El TR and are
able to have production 247 so we
definitely need to see how to become
better at that and the reason why I say
better is because only 133% of European
businesses are currently applying AI in
their operations so I think there's a
long way to go there and to explore how
to connect those innovative ideas or
emerging Technologies with our
stronghold our traditional Industries do
you think there are particular countries
or other regions in the world that are
doing it better when it comes to digital
innovation how they're applying it to
their economy and is it thriving
somewhere else do you think the EU can
learn from any other regions I would
like to give an example of the past in a
way if I may I mean if we if we look a
number of years back we could see that
the UK was one of the places that came
up with a lot of innovative ideas but
the countries that apply those
Innovations such as Germany and the
United States became industrial
powerhouses so I think it's good to take
inspiration uh from you know all the
Innovations and breakthroughs that are
happening but it will be ultimately the
test on who manages to adopt the
technology and I think uh Europe can
lead in that domain while in the same
time of course advancing its uh
Innovative potential do you think
Europe's uh regulatory leadership in AI
uh will create a global benchmark or do
you think it will sort of exacerbate
geopolitical tensions when it's you know
competing ethically with the US with
China
Etc I think the answer today is very
different than the answer I would have
given a few months ago where we were
seeing way more willingness for
Democratic allies to align on AI
standardization for example and the way
we approach the risks and also
opportunities AI today we see very
different approaches so to a certain
extent Europe is um you know leading the
way in making sure that we see the
development of AI in a risk-based
approach so there are certain
technologies that will not abide by any
regulations and there are others that
are powered by AI that will need to go
through certain checks and balances and
there are those that are also ban such
as social scoring um so the European way
of regulating uh is a risk-based way um
and we have seen that yes not all
countries at the moment are willing to
take that approach uh but I think we
need to be thinking ahead we need to be
thinking that those Technologies are not
necessarily
trustworthy um and we need more checks
and balances in order to make sure that
they're trustworthy Technologies for our
societies because it's only then the
citizens will have the confidence um to
use them um and then perhaps those
Technologies can serve the common good
well just one last question before uh
before we leave how will the EU
navigate some of the push back against
you know the ethical principles of the
AI regulatory system that is putting
into place when you have some other
countries that are trying to to stifle
regulation in order to to push
Innovation I think the approaches are
different and you could explain them
many different ways but I'll take one
example to explain for example the US
approach to advancements in emerging
Tech and particularly AI compared to the
European approach in Europe right now we
would like to see more competitiveness
that's powered by those new technologies
in the US Sumer speaking about a race
but even more often you would hear that
uh the talk is about winning the AI War
which basically means making sure that
you make the best advant ANC Ms so that
you could win the defense AI uh war that
according to the US is playing out there
so these are two different approaches in
what you're trying to achieve of course
the US is also making wanting to make
sure that they stay competitive but they
see a bigger stake compared to the one
we see in Europe at the moment so if
you're to win a war you're willing to
unleash all resources make sure there's
no regulation to get there first um I
think the the the way we need to see
this conversation is way more complex
even for the purposes of this chat uh
today um and and it requires more
details but this is just you know a
brief um sketch of the different
approaches um and yeah if if you have a
different end goal you're going to use
different means and I and I don't think
our end goals are aligned at the moment
to be honest well it's been absolutely
fascinating talking with you AA thank
you so much for your time I know
extremely busy so thank you appreciate
it thanks for having me take care
