# Recital 67

## Overview

High-quality data and access to high-quality data plays a vital role in providing structure and in ensuring the performance of many AI systems, especially when techniques involving the training of models are used, with a view to ensure that the high-risk AI system performs as intended and safely. It does not mean that data governance must be overly complex or costly. High-quality data sets for training, validation, and testing require the implementation of appropriate data governance and management practices. Data sets for training, validation, and testing, including the labels, should be relevant, sufficiently representative, and to the best extent possible free of errors and complete in view of the intended purpose of the system. In order to facilitate compliance with Union data protection law, such as Regulation (EU) 2016/679, data governance and management practices should include transparency about the original purpose of the data collection. The data sets should also have appropriate statistical properties, including as regards the persons or groups of persons in relation to whom the high-risk AI system is intended to be used, with specific attention to mitigating potential biases in these datasets that may negatively impact health, safety, fundamental rights, or discrimination prohibited under Union law.
