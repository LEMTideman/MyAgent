If an AI system is deemed to present a risk, the authority will evaluate its compliance with the AI Act, with particular attention on risks to vulnerable groups. If non-compliance is found, the authority will require corrective actions, including potential withdrawal or recall of the AI system. The authority will inform the European Commission and other Member States if the non-compliance is not limited to its territory. If the operator does not take adequate corrective action, the authority will take provisional measures to restrict or prohibit the AI system and notify other authorities. The measures will be deemed justified if no objections are raised within three months, or 30 days for serious non-compliance.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n## Article 79\n\n### 1. Definition of \"AI systems presenting a risk\"\n\nAI systems presenting a risk shall be understood as a 'product presenting a risk' as defined in [Article 3](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-3), point 19 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, in so far as they present risks to the health or safety, or to fundamental rights, of persons.\n\n### 2. Evaluation process\n\nWhere the market surveillance authority of a Member State has sufficient reason to consider an AI system to present a risk as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, it shall carry out an evaluation of the AI system concerned in respect of its compliance with all the requirements and obligations laid down in this Regulation. Particular attention shall be given to AI systems presenting a risk to vulnerable groups. Where risks to fundamental rights are identified, the market surveillance authority shall also inform and fully cooperate with the relevant national public authorities or bodies referred to in [Article 77(1)](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-77). The relevant operators shall cooperate as necessary with the market surveillance authority and with the other national public authorities or bodies referred to in [Article 77(1)](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-77).\n\nWhere, in the course of that evaluation, the market surveillance authority or, where applicable, the market surveillance authority in cooperation with the national public authority referred to in [Article 77(1)](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-77), finds that the AI system does not comply with the requirements and obligations laid down in this Regulation, it shall without undue delay require the relevant operator to take all appropriate corrective actions to bring the AI system into compliance, to withdraw the AI system from the market, or to recall it within a period specified by the market surveillance authority. In any event, within a shorter time frame than prescribed by Union harmonisation legislation.\n\nThe market surveillance authority shall inform:\n* The relevant notified body accordingly.\n* [Article 18](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-18) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 applies.\n\n### 3. Notification about non-compliance\n\nWhere there is insufficient evidence that an AI system presents a risk within its own jurisdiction but could pose significant risks elsewhere,\n* The operator must ensure that all appropriate corrective action is taken regarding all affected products.\n* The market surveillance authority should inform both:\n\t+ The Commission.\n\t+ All other Member States.\n* Any additional information concerning non-compliance should be shared promptly.\n* Objections from either a member state's market surveillance agency or from Europe's Commission must be addressed within three months unless agreed otherwise.\n\n### 4. Actions beyond three months\n\nIf no objections have been raised within three months,\n* Provisional measures can still be implemented based on preliminary findings.\n* However,\n\t+ There is no longer time left for raising objections.\n\t+ Three months is considered sufficient before imposing restrictions on products or services across borders.\n\n### 5. Notification of provisional measures\n\nIn case provisional measures were imposed under paragraph 3 above,\n* They should be communicated immediately via email and published on their respective websites.\n* Operators must be informed through emails sent directly by these entities.\n* A summary report detailing all available details must accompany each notification.\n* It includes information needed for identifying affected products/services from different sources like suppliers/distributors/etc., supply chains etc.,\n* Non-compliance reasons are included too.\n* Suppliers/distributors/etc., supply chains etc.,\n* Duration of provisional measures applied\n* Arguments supporting them\n* Reasons why they cannot be shortened\n* Time limit for objections\n* Deadline for making responses\n* Argument against granting permission\n```",
