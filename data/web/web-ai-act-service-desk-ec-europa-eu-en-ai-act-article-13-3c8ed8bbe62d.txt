# Article 13: Transparency and provision of information to deployers

## Chapter III: High-Risk AI Systems

### Section 2: Requirements for High-Risk AI Systems

#### Summary
High-risk AI systems must be designed to ensure their operation is sufficiently transparent, allowing deployers to understand and appropriately use their outputs. They must come with clear, comprehensive instructions that include provider contact details, system characteristics, capabilities and limitations of performance. The information provided should include, inter alia, intended purpose, the level of accuracy, robustness, cybersecurity, and potential risks. Instructions should also detail human oversight measures, computational and hardware requirements, maintenance needs, and logging mechanisms to ensure proper functioning and compliance.

The summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.
