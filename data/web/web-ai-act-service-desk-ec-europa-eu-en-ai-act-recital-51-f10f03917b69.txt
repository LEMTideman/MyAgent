# Recital 51

The classification of an AI system as high-risk pursuant to this Regulation should not necessarily mean that the product whose safety component is the AI system, or the AI system itself as a product, is considered to be high-risk under the criteria established in the relevant Union harmonisation legislation that applies to the product. This is, in particular, the case for Regulations (EU) 2017/745 and (EU) 2017/746, where a third-party conformity assessment is provided for medium-risk and high-risk products.

## This Recital relates to

*   [Article 6: Classification rules for high-risk AI systems](/en/ai-act/article-6)
*   [Article 46: Derogation from conformity assessment procedure](/en/ai-act/article-46)
