The AI Office should be able to carry out all necessary actions to monitor the effective implementation of this Regulation as regards general-purpose AI models. It should be able to investigate possible infringements of the rules on providers of general-purpose AI models both on its own initiative, following the results of its monitoring activities, or upon request from market surveillance authorities in line with the conditions set out in this Regulation. To support effective monitoring of the AI Office, it should provide for the possibility that downstream providers lodge complaints about possible infringements of the rules on providers of general-purpose AI models and systems.\n\n## This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 74: Market surveillance and control of AI systems in the Union market](/en/ai-act/article-74)\n*   [Article 75: Mutual assistance, market surveillance and control of general-purpose AI systems](/en/ai-act/article-75)\n*   [Article 88: Enforcement of the obligations of providers of general-purpose AI models](/en/ai-act/article-88)\n*   [Article 93: Power to request measures](/en/ai-act/article-93)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).
