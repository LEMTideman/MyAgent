In that respect, each Member State should designate at least one notifying authority and at least one market surveillance authority as national competent authorities for the purpose of supervising the application and implementation of this Regulation. Member States may decide to appoint any kind of public entity to perform the tasks of the national competent authorities within the meaning of this Regulation, in accordance with their specific national organisational characteristics and needs. In order to increase organisation efficiency on the side of Member States and to set a single point of contact vis-à-vis the public and other counterparts at Member State and Union levels, each Member State should designate a market surveillance authority to act as a single point of contact.\n\n## This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 28: Notifying authorities](/en/ai-act/article-28)\n*   [Article 29: Application of a conformity assessment body for notification](/en/ai-act/article-29)\n*   [Article 70: Designation of national competent authorities and a single point of contact](/en/ai-act/article-70)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).
