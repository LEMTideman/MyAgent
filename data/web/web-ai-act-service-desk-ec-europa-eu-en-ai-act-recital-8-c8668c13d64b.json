  "text": "```markdown\n# Recital 8\n\nA Union legal framework laying down harmonised rules on AI is therefore needed to foster the development, use and uptake of AI in the internal market that at the same time meets a high level of protection of public interests, such as health and safety and the protection of fundamental rights, including democracy, the rule of law and environmental protection as recognised and protected by Union law. To achieve that objective, rules regulating the placing on the market, the putting into service and the use of certain AI systems should be laid down, thus ensuring the smooth functioning of the internal market and allowing those systems to benefit from the principle of free movement of goods and services. Those rules should be clear and robust in protecting fundamental rights, supportive of new innovative solutions, enabling a European ecosystem of public and private actors creating AI systems in line with Union values and unlocking the potential of the digital transformation across all regions of the Union. By laying down those rules as well as measures in support of innovation with a particular focus on small and medium enterprises (SMEs), including startups, this Regulation supports the objective of promoting the European human-centric approach to AI and being a global leader in the development of secure, trustworthy and ethical AI as stated by the European Council [(5)](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/45910/021020-euco-final-conclusions.pdf), and it ensures the protection of ethical principles, as specifically requested by the European Parliament [(6)](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2020-0275_EN.html).\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 1: Subject matter](/en/ai-act/article-1)\n*   [Article 77: Powers of authorities protecting fundamental rights](/en/ai-act/article-77)\n\n---\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).
