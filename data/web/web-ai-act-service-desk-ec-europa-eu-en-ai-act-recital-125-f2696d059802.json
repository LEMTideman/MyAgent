However, given the current experience of professional pre-market certifiers in the field of product safety and the different nature of risks involved, it is appropriate to limit, at least in an initial phase of application of this Regulation, the scope of application of third-party conformity assessment for high-risk AI systems other than those related to products. Therefore, the conformity assessment of such systems should be carried out as a general rule by the provider under its own responsibility, with the only exception of AI systems intended to be used for biometrics.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 30: Notification procedure](/en/ai-act/article-30)\n*   [Article 31: Requirements relating to notified bodies](/en/ai-act/article-31)\n*   [Article 34: Operational obligations of notified bodies](/en/ai-act/article-34)\n*   [Article 43: Conformity assessment](/en/ai-act/article-43)\n\n---\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).
