This system should be a continuous process throughout the high-risk AI system's lifecycle, regularly reviewed and updated. Risk management measures aim to eliminate or reduce risks through design, mitigation, and user information. Testing is required to ensure compliance and performance, with consideration for persons under the age of 18 and vulnerable groups. Providers can integrate these requirements with existing risk management processes under other EU laws.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n## Article 9: Risk management system\n\n### Step 1: Identify and analyze risks\n\nA risk management system shall be established, implemented, documented and maintained in relation to high-risk AI systems. The risk management system shall be understood as a continuous iterative process planned and run throughout the entire lifecycle of a high-risk AI system, requiring regular systematic review and updating. It shall comprise the following steps:\n\n- **(a)** The identification and analysis of the known and the reasonably foreseeable risks that the high-risk AI system can pose to health, safety or fundamental rights when the high-risk AI system is used in accordance with its intended purpose;\n- **(b)** The estimation and evaluation of the risks that may emerge when the high-risk AI system is used in accordance with its intended purpose, and under conditions of reasonably foreseeable misuse;\n- **(c)** The evaluation of other risks possibly arising, based on the analysis of data gathered from the post-market monitoring system referred to in [Article 72](/en/ai-act/article-72);\n- **(d)** The adoption of appropriate and targeted risk management measures designed to address the risks identified pursuant to point (a).\n\n### Step 2: Estimate and evaluate risks\n\nThe risks referred to in this Article shall concern only those which may be reasonably mitigated or eliminated through the development or design of the high-risk AI system, or the provision of adequate technical information.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate other risks\n\nThe risk management measures referred to in paragraph 2, point (d), shall give due consideration to the effects and possible interaction resulting from the combined application of the requirements set out in this Section, with a view to minimizing risks more effectively while achieving an appropriate balance in implementing the measures to fulfill those requirements.\n\n### Step 4: Adopt targeted measures\n\nThe risk management measures referred to in paragraph 2, point (d), shall be such that the relevant residual risk associated with each hazard, as well as the overall residual risk of the high-risk AI systems is judged to be acceptable.\n\nIn identifying the most appropriate risk management measures, the following shall be ensured:\n- Elimination or reduction of risks identified and evaluated pursuant to paragraph 2 in as far as technically feasible through adequate design and development of the high-risk AI system;\n- Where appropriate, implementation of adequate mitigation and control measures addressing risks that cannot be eliminated;\n- Provision of information required pursuant to [Article 13](/en/ai-act/article-13) and, where appropriate, training to deployers.\n\nWith a view to eliminating or reducing risks related to the use of the high-risk AI system, due consideration shall be given to technical knowledge, experience, education, the training to be expected by the deployer, and the presumable context in which the system is intended to be used.\n\n### Step 5: Test for compliance\n\nHigh-risk AI systems shall be tested for purposes of identifying appropriate and targeted risk management measures. Testing shall ensure that high-risk AI systems perform consistently for their intended purpose and that they are compliant with requirements set out in this Section.\n\nTesting procedures may include testing in real-world conditions in accordance with [Article 60](/en/ai-act/article-60).\n\n### Step 6: Perform testing throughout lifecycle\n\nWhen implementing a risk management system as provided for in paragraphs 1 to 7, providers shall consider whether in view of its intended purpose it is likely to have an adverse impact on persons under 18 or other vulnerable groups.\n\nFor providers of high-risk AI systems that are subject to requirements regarding internal risk management processes under other relevant provisions of Union law, aspects provided in paragraphs 1 to 9 may form part of or combine with risk management procedures established pursuant to those laws.\n\n## Relevant Recitals\n\n*   [Recital 64](/en/ai-act/recital-64)\n*   [Recital 65](/en/ai-act/recital-65)\n*   [Recital 71](/en/ai-act/recital-71)\n\nView official text: [Artificial Intelligence Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).\n```", "fetched_at_utc": "2025-12-28T19:45:55Z", "sha256": "207116602bd25b2630f851a215fe83e252db15050b4ebb4a5d96e7b93b8b220a", "meta": {"jina_status": 20000, "jina_code": 200, "description": null, "links": null, "images": null, "usage": {"tokens": 12000}}}

The European Commission can update the documentation requirements to keep pace with technical advancements.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n### 1. The technical documentation of a high-risk AI system shall be drawn up before that system is placed on the market or put into service and shall be kept up-to-date.\n\nThe technical documentation shall be drawn up in such a way as to demonstrate that the high-risk AI system complies with the requirements set out in this Section and to provide national competent authorities and notified bodies with the necessary information in a clear and comprehensive form to assess the compliance of the AI system with those requirements. It shall contain, at a minimum, the elements set out in [Annex IV](/en/ai-act/annex-4). SMEs, including start-ups, may provide the elements of the technical documentation specified in [Annex IV](/en/ai-act/annex-4) in a simplified manner. To that end, the Commission shall establish a simplified technical documentation form targeted at the needs of small and microenterprises. Where an SME, including a start-up, opts to provide the information required in [Annex IV](/en/ai-act/annex-4) in a simplified manner, it shall use the form referred to in this paragraph. Notified bodies shall accept the form for the purposes of the conformity assessment.\n\n### 2. Where a high-risk AI system related to a product covered by the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Section A of [Annex I](/en/ai-act/annex-1) is placed on the market or put into service, a single set of technical documentation shall be drawn up containing all the information set out in paragraph 1, as well as the information required under those legal acts.\n\n### 3. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with [Article 97](/en/ai-act/article-97) in order to amend [Annex IV](/en/ai-act/annex-4), where necessary, to ensure that, in light of technical progress, the technical documentation provides all the information necessary to assess the compliance of the system with the requirements set out in this Section.\n\n#### Relevant recitals\n*   [Recital 66](/en/ai-act/recital-66)\n*   [Recital 71](/en/ai-act/recital-71)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/html/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).

Any distributor, importer, deployer or other third-party shall be considered to be a provider of a high-risk AI system for the purposes of this Regulation and shall be subject to the obligations of the provider under [Article 16](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-16), in any of the following circumstances:\n\n- (a) they put their name or trademark on a high-risk AI system already placed on the market or put into service, without prejudice to contractual arrangements stipulating that the obligations are otherwise allocated;\n- (b) they make a substantial modification to a high-risk AI system that has already been placed on the market or has already been put into service in such a way that it remains a high-risk AI system pursuant to [Article 6](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-6);\n- (c) they modify the intended purpose of an AI system, including a general-purpose AI system, which has not been classified as high-risk and has already been placed on the market or put into service in such a way that the AI system concerned becomes a high-risk AI system in accordance with [Article 6](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-6).\n\n#### 2. Where the circumstances referred to in paragraph 1 occur, the provider that initially placed the AI system on the market or put it into service shall no longer be considered to be a provider of that specific AI system for the purposes of this Regulation. That initial provider shall closely cooperate with new providers and shall make available the necessary information and provide the reasonably expected technical access and other assistance that are required for the fulfillment of the obligations set out in this Regulation, in particular regarding compliance with the conformity assessment of high-risk AI systems. This paragraph shall not apply in cases where the initial provider has clearly specified that its AI system is not to be changed into a high-risk AI system and therefore does not fall under the obligation to hand over documentation.\n\n#### 3. In the case of high-risk AI systems that are safety components of products covered by the Union harmonization legislation listed in Section A of [Annex I](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-1), the product manufacturer shall be considered to be the provider of the high-risk AI system, and shall be subject to the obligations under [Article 16](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-16) under either of the following circumstances:\n\n- (a)the high-risk AI system is placed on the market together with the product under the name or trademark of the product manufacturer;\n- (b)the high-risk AI system is put into service under the name or trademark of the product manufacturer after the product has been placed on sale.\n\n#### 4. The provider of a high-risk AI system and third party that supplies an AI system, tools, services, components, or processes that are used or integrated in a high-risk AI system shall by written agreement specify necessary information capabilities technical access and other assistance based on generally acknowledged state-of-the-art in order to enable full compliance with obligations set out in this Regulation. This paragraph shall not apply to third parties making accessible to public tools services processes components other than general-purpose AI models under free and open-source license.\n\nThe **AI Office** may develop and recommend voluntary model terms for contracts between providers高风险人工智能系统和第三方供应商，以确保提供商能够完全遵守本法规的义务。这些自愿模型条款应遵循一般公认的行业标准，在具体领域或业务场景中考虑可能适用的合同要求。自愿模型条款应在免费、易于使用的电子格式下发布并供公众下载。\n\n#### 5.

They must manage input data, keep logs for at least six months, and inform providers and authorities of any risks or incidents. Deployers must also notify workers’ representatives and the affected workers if the system is used in the workplace. Public authorities deploying high-risk AI systems must comply with registration obligations (see [Article 49](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-49)) and ensure the system is registered in the EU database. Deployers must inform individuals subject to AI-assisted decisions and cooperate with authorities on regulatory actions.\n\nLaw enforcement authorities using high-risk AI system for post-remote biometric identification in targeted searches shall obtain authorisation in advance or not later than within 48 hours, save some exceptions. Each use must be documented, and annual reports submitted to authorities. \n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n1. Deployers of high-risk AI systems shall take appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure they use such systems in accordance with the instructions for use accompanying the systems, pursuant to paragraphs 3 and 6.\n2. Deployers shall assign human oversight to natural persons who have the necessary competence, training and authority, as well as the necessary support.\n3. The obligations set out in paragraphs 1 and 2, are without prejudice to other deployer obligations under Union or national law and to the deployer’s freedom to organise its own resources and activities for the purpose of implementing the human oversight measures indicated by the provider.\n4. Without prejudice to paragraphs 1 and 2, to the extent the deployer exercises control over the input data, that deployer shall ensure that input data is relevant and sufficiently representative in view of the intended purpose of the high-risk AI system.\n5. Deployers shall monitor the operation of the high-risk AI system on the basis of the instructions for use and, where relevant, inform providers in accordance with [Article 72](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-72). Where deployers have reason to consider that the use of the high-risk AI system in accordance with the instructions may result in that AI system presenting a risk within the meaning of [Article 79(1)](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-79), they shall, without undue delay, inform the provider or distributor and the relevant market surveillance authority, and shall suspend the use of that system. Where deployers have identified a serious incident, they shall also immediately inform first the provider, and then the importer or distributor and the relevant market surveillance authorities of that incident. If the deployer is not able to reach the provider, [Article 73](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-73) shall apply _mutatis mutandis_. This obligation shall not cover sensitive operational data of deployers of AI systems which are law enforcement authorities.\n\nFor deployers that are financial institutions subject to requirements regarding their internal governance, arrangements or processes under Union financial services law, the monitoring obligation set out in paragraph 5 shall be deemed to be fulfilled by complying with rules on internal governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms pursuant to relevant financial service law.\n\n6. Deployers of high-risk AI systems shall keep the logs automatically generated by that high-risk AI system to a period appropriate for its intended purpose of use, for at least six months unless provided otherwise in applicable Union or national law, particularly in Union law on personal data protection.\n\nDeployers that are financial institutions subject to requirements regarding their internal governance arrangements processes under Union financial services law shall maintain these logs as part of their documentation kept pursuant to relevant Union financial service law.\n\n7. Before putting into service or using a high-risk AI system at workstations employed by employees (employing companies), deployors who employ employees shall inform them about being subject to this high-risk AI system's usage. This information should be provided according to existing rules on employee information transparency.\n\n8. Deployers who are public authorities or entities under Union law governing communications networks content technology (Connect Directorate-General) shall comply with registration obligations referred to in [Article 49](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-49). When such entities find that a new high-risk AI system planned for use has not been registered in Annex III (the list), they cannot utilize that system until authorization is obtained through judicial authority or administrative authority whose decision is legally binding subject to judicial review.\n\n9. Where applicable, entities deploying high-risk AI systems can access information provided under [Article 13](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-13) concerning their responsibilities under personal data protection impact assessments under Regulation (EU) No 2016/679 or Directive (EU) No 2016/680.\n\n10. Without prejudice to Directive (EU) No 2016/680 (personal data protection impact assessment), when investigating targeted searches involving potential suspects suspected or convicted of committing crimes via remote biometrics identification technologies like post remote biometric identification (PRBI), entities deploying PRBI technologies would need an authorisation granted ex ante before utilizing those technologies unless approved otherwise by judicial authority or administrative authority whose decision is legally binding subject to judicial review.\n\nIf an entity requests authorization due to authorized investigations involving targets suspected or convicted of crimes via remote biometrics identification technologies like PRBI but receives a denial from judicial authority or administrative authority whose decision is legally binding subject to judicial review:\n\n* The entity would stop using associated POST remote biometric identification technologies linked directly thereto.\n* Personal data related exclusively used for these purposes would be deleted.\n* These technologies could only be utilized for initial identity verification based on objective verifiable facts directly linked specifically towards crime-related offenses rather than targeting specific individuals without connection.\n* Decisions produced solely based on outputs from these technologies would not produce adverse legal effects against individuals without explicit justification.\n* Judicial supervision bodies would play roles similar as per Directive (EU) No 2016/680 regarding supervisory authorities' duties.\n\nThis clause does not restrict how entities might operate beyond what mandatory provisions require under Directive (EU) No 2016/680 regarding supervisory bodies' functions.\n\nEntities deploying PRBI technologies would submit annual reports detailing their utilization patterns while ensuring confidentiality over sensitive operational data pertaining exclusively related with justice endeavors conducted through these technologies – except disclosures needed during audits directed towards justice-related matters requiring compliance with privacy regulations.\n\nMembers states may establish additional restrictions on PRBI technology usage consistent with Union laws on personal data protection.\n\n11. Entities deploying high-risk AI systems listed in Annex III must disclose all such information within three years after placing them onto commercial markets unless mandated otherwise by Union legislation.\n12. Entities deploying high-risk AI systems listed in Annex III must collaborate closely with competent authorities involved in handling such issues as required by Union legislation.\n\n### Relevant Recitals\n\n* [Recital 84](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-84)\n* [Recital 91](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-91)\n* [Recital 92](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-92)\n* [Recital 93](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-93)\n* [Recital 95](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-95)\n* [Recital 96](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-96)\n* [Recital 134](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-134)\n* [Recital 136](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recialtment%EF%B8%8F%EF%B8%AD%E2%80%A6%E2%80%A6%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0_%C4%BEv.%C3%BCr.%C3%ACn.+L._+II+%E5%B7%B4+%E5%B7%B4+%E5%B7%B4+%E5%B7%B4+%E5%B7%B4+%E5%B7%B4+%E5%B7%B4+%E5%B7%B4+%E5%B7%B4+%E5%B7%B4+%E5%B7%B4+%E5%B7%B4+%E5+BfB&amp;utm_source=sharethis.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=sharethis_social_sharing_button&amp;ttw.share-this-share-buttons-button&amp;url=https:%2F%2Fwww.ai.act.service.desksite.ee%2Fen%2Faifaq-questionnaire-answer\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Share this article</a>\n```", "fetched_at_utc": "2025-12-28T19:52:48Z", "sha256": "aa7d7ff857ba6214c2dd5b1ad88999469502fb65e137e2e3ab095834e5af2dbc", "meta": {"jina_status": 20000, "jina_code": 200, "description": null, "links": null, "images": null, "usage": {"tokens": 12000}}}

This assessment is required for the first use and must be updated if changes occur. Deployers must notify authorities of the results using a provided template, unless exempt. The assessment complements existing data protection impact assessments.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n1. Prior to deploying a high-risk AI system referred to in [Article 6(2)](/en/ai-act/article-6), with the exception of high-risk AI systems intended to be used in the area listed in point 2 of [Annex III](/en/ai-act/annex-3), deployers that are bodies governed by public law, or are private entities providing public services, and deployers of high-risk AI systems referred to in points 5 (b) and (c) of [Annex III](/en/ai-act/annex-3), shall perform an assessment of the impact on fundamental rights that the use of such system may produce. For that purpose, deployers shall perform an assessment consisting of:\n\n   - a description of the deployer’s processes in which the high-risk AI system will be used in line with its intended purpose;\n   - a description of the period of time within which, and the frequency with which, each high-risk AI system is intended to be used;\n   - the categories of natural persons and groups likely to be affected by its use in the specific context;\n   - the specific risks of harm likely to have an impact on the categories of natural persons or groups of persons identified pursuant to point (c) of this paragraph, taking into account the information given by the provider pursuant to [Article 13](/en/ai-act/article-13);\n   - a description of the implementation of human oversight measures, according to the instructions for use;\n   - the measures to be taken in the case of the materialisation of those risks, including the arrangements for internal governance and complaint mechanisms.\n\n2. The obligation laid down in paragraph 1 applies to the first use of the high-risk AI system. The deployer may, in similar cases, rely on previously conducted fundamental rights impact assessments or existing impact assessments carried out by provider. If, during the use of the high-risk AI system, the deployer considers that any of the elements listed in paragraph 1 has changed or is no longer up to date, the deployer shall take the necessary steps to update the information.\n\n3. Once the assessment referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article has been performed, the deployer shall notify the market surveillance authority of its results, submitting the filled-out template referred to in paragraph 5 of this Article as part of the notification. In the case referred to in [Article 46(1)](/en/ai-act/article-46), deployers may be exempt from that obligation to notify.\n\n4. If any of the obligations laid down in this Article is already met through the data protection impact assessment conducted pursuant to [Article 35](/en/ai-act/article-35) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or [Article 27](/en/ai-act/article-27) of Directive (EU) 2016/680, the fundamental rights impact assessment referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall complement that data protection impact assessment.\n\n5.

If a notified body decides to stop its conformity assessment activities, it must inform the notifying authority and affected providers immediately, and, in case of planned cessation, at least one year before ceasing operations. The notified body's certificates can remain valid for nine months after it stops, provided another notified body agrees to take over responsibility for the high-risk AI systems. If a notified body no longer meets requirements, the notifying authority will investigate and may restrict, suspend, or withdraw its designation, informing the Commission and other Member States. The notified body must then inform providers within 10 days. The notifying authority will assess the impact on issued certificates, submit a report, and ensure that unduly issued certificates are suspended or withdrawn. Certificates remain valid under certain conditions during suspension, restriction, or withdrawal, with another notified body assuming responsibility if needed.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n## Section 4: Notifying Authorities and Notified Bodies\n\n### Article 36: Changes to notifications\n\n#### Summary\n\nNotifying authorities must inform the Commission and the other Member States of any relevant changes to the notification of a notified body via the electronic notification tool referred to in [Article 30(2)](/en/ai-act/article-30).\n\n#### Paragraphs\n\n1. The notifying authority shall notify the Commission and the other Member States of any relevant changes to the notification of a notified body via the electronic notification tool referred to in [Article 30(2)](/en/ai-act/article-30).\n   \n2. The procedures laid down in Articles 29 and 30 shall apply to extensions of the scope of the notification.\n   For changes to the notification other than extensions of its scope, the procedures laid down in paragraphs (3) to (9) shall apply.\n   \n3. Where a notified body decides to cease its conformity assessment activities, it shall inform the notifying authority and the providers concerned as soon as possible and, in the case of a planned cessation, at least one year before ceasing its activities. The certificates of the notified body may remain valid for a period of nine months after cessation of the notified body’s activities, on condition that another notified body has confirmed in writing that it will assume responsibilities for the high-risk AI systems covered by those certificates. The latter notified body shall complete a full assessment of the high-risk AI systems affected by the end of that nine-month-period before issuing new certificates for those systems. Where the notified body has ceased its activity, the notifying authority shall withdraw the designation.\n   \n4. Where a notifying authority has sufficient reason to consider that a notified body no longer meets the requirements laid down in [Article 31](/en/ai-act/article-31), or that it is failing to fulfill its obligations, the notifying authority shall without delay investigate the matter with utmost diligence. In that context, it shall inform the notified body concerned about the objections raised and give it the possibility to make its views known. If the notifying authority comes to conclude that:\n   - (a) The notified body no longer meets requirements laid down in [Article 31](/en/ai-act/article-31) or fails to fulfill obligations.\n   - (b) There is no risk to health, safety or fundamental rights associated with certificates affected by suspension or restriction.\n   - (c) Another qualified notified body assumes immediate responsibility for high-risk AI systems covered by those certificates.\n   Then:\n   - (d) Assess impact on issued certificates.\n   - (e) Submit report on findings within three months.\n   - (f) Require certified bodies whose issuance was unduly influenced by suspension or restriction be suspended or withdrawn promptly.\n   - (g) Inform Commission and Member States about certificate suspensions or withdrawals.\n   - (h) Provide national competent authorities with information about affected certifications regarding certificates suspended or withdrawn.\n\n5. Where its designation has been suspended, restricted, or fully or partially withdrawn,通知体（Notifyee）应立即通知其提供方，以确保文件保留并使它们可供其他成员国和市场监督机构使用。\n6. 在暂停、限制或撤销通知的情况下，通知体应采取适当的步骤来确保文件的保存，并在必要时避免潜在对健康、安全或基本权利的风险。\n\n7. 如果通知体决定停止其认证评估活动，则应及时告知通知员和受影响的提供者。如果计划终止，应在至少一年前告知通知员。\n8. 当暂停、限制或撤销通知时，通知员将进行调查并尽快确认是否需要纠正措施。如果认为通知体不再符合要求或未能履行义务，则有权对其进行限制、暂停或撤消指定。\n9. 若通知员有充分理由怀疑通知体不再满足要求或未履行义务，则无需等待进一步报告即可进行调查。在此期间，通知员应向被通知体提出异议，并给予机会做出回应。若发现任何问题，通知员可采取相应行动：\n   - (a) 调查影响证书的影响。\n   - (b) 提交一份报告，说明其发现及建议采取的具体行动时间表。\n   - (c) 要求被通知体在三个月内提交另一家合格的通知员负责该高风险人工智能系统的证明材料。\n10. 在暂停、限制或撤销指定后，证书的有效期为九个月，在此期间：\n    - (a) 告知委任人有关证书中可能存在的风险。\n    - (b) 其他合格的通知人在书面形式上表示他们将在规定时间内承担相关证书的责任。\n\n### Relevant Recitals\n\n* [Recital 126](/en/ai-act/recital-126)\n\nView [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).

If these standards are not fully applied or are restricted, or common specifications were not available or were not applied by the provider, assessment with a notified body is required.\n\nFor high-risk AI systems listed in points 2 to 8 of [Annex III](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-3), providers must follow an internal control conformity assessment without involving a notified body.\n\nFor high-risk AI systems covered by existing EU legislation listed in Section A of [Annex I](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-1), the provider must follow the relevant conformity assessment procedures, with notified bodies ensuring compliance with AI-specific requirements. Substantial modifications to AI systems require new conformity assessments, except for predetermined changes in systems that continue to learn.\n\nHigh-risk AI systems must undergo a new conformity assessment if substantially modified, unless changes are predetermined and documented. The Commission can update annexes and conformity assessment procedures through delegated acts, considering the effectiveness of internal control and the capacity of notified bodies.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n## Article 43: Conformity assessment\n\n### For high-risk AI systems listed in point 1 of [Annex III](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-3)\n\nWhere, in demonstrating the compliance of a high-risk AI system with the requirements set out in Section 2, the provider has applied harmonised standards referred to in [Article 40](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-40), or where applicable, common specifications referred to in [Article 41](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-41), the provider shall opt for one of the following conformity assessment procedures based on:\n\n(a) the internal control referred to in [Annex VI](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-6); or\n\n(b) the assessment of the quality management system and the assessment of the technical documentation, with the involvement of a notified body, referred to in [Annex VII](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-7).\n\nIn demonstrating the compliance of a high-risk AI system with the requirements set out in Section 2, the provider shall follow the conformity assessment procedure set out in [Annex VII](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-7) where:\n\n(a) harmonised standards referred to in [Article 40](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-40) do not exist, and common specifications referred to in [Article 41](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-41) are not available;\n\n(b) the provider has not applied, or has applied only part of, the harmonised standard;\n\n(c) the common specifications referred to in point (a) exist, but the provider has not applied them;\n\n(d) one or more of the harmonised standards referred to in point (a) has been published with a restriction, and only on the part of the standard that was restricted.\n\nFor the purposes of the conformity assessment procedure referred to in [Annex VII](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-7), the provider may choose any of the notified bodies. However, where the high-risk AI system is intended to be put into service by law enforcement, immigration or asylum authorities or by Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, the market surveillance authority referred to in [Article 74(8)](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-74)(9), as applicable, shall act as a notified body.\n\n### For high-risk AI systems referred to in points 2 to 8 of [Annex III](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-3)\n\nProviders shall follow the conformity assessment procedure based on internal control as referred to in [Annex VI](https://ai-act-service-deskbdec.epa.fr/content/dam/opendata/publications/AI%20Act/SIP%20-%20En/FichiersSIP/AI%20Act%20-%20Conformance%20assessment.pdf#page=5).\n\n### For high-risk AI systems covered by EU harmonisation legislation listed in Section A of [Annex I](https://aiservicedesk.eeas-upr.es/content/dam/opendata/publications/AI%20Act/SIP%20-%20En/FichiersSIP/AI%20Act%20-%20Conformance%20assessment.pdf#page=5)\n\nThe provider shall follow the relevant conformity assessment procedure as required under those legal acts. The requirements set out in Section 2 of this Chapter shall apply to those high-risk AI systems and shall be part of that assessment. Points 4.3., 4.4., 4.5. and paragraph’s five paragraph fof point 4.6. ([Annex VII](https://aiservicedesk.eeas-upr.es/content/dam/opendata/publications/AI%20Act/SIP%20-%20En/FichiersSIP/AI%20Act%20-%20Conformance%20assessment.pdf#page=5)) shall also apply.\n\nFor instance:\n* One cannot use an option like “opt-out” from third-party certification due to lackluster results when combined with other options.\n* It is important that manufacturers who opted out from third-party certification ensure they have implemented all harmonized standards covering all relevant requirements before using that option again.\n* Manufacturers should also ensure they have applied both harmonized standards and common specifications referenced in Article IV.\n\n### High-risk AI systems that have already been subject to a conformity assessment procedure\n\nHigh-risk AI systems that have already been subject to a conformity assessment procedure shall undergo a new conformity assessment procedure in case of substantial modification (regardless whether modified system is intended for distribution or continued usage by current deployer).\n\nFor high-risk AI systems that continue learning after being placed on market or put into service:\n* Changes pre-determined by manufacturer at time initial conformance assessment are considered substantial modifications.\n* These changes do not constitute substantial modification if performed according guidelines outlined above.\n\n### Commission's powers\n\nThe Commission is empowered:\n* To adopt delegated acts updating Annexes VI and VII by updating them based on technical progress.\n* To adopt delegated acts

That authorisation shall be for a limited period while the necessary conformity assessment procedures are being carried out. In urgent situations, law enforcement or civil protection authorities may put high-risk AI systems into service without prior authorisation, but must request authorisation promptly.\n\nThe market surveillance authority is required to inform the Commission and other Member States of such authorisations. The authorisation is valid if the AI system complies with regulatory requirements and no objections are raised within 15 days. If objections are raised, the Commission will consult with the relevant Member State and operators to decide if the authorisation is justified. If deemed unjustified, the authorisation will be withdrawn. For AI systems covered by existing EU legislation listed in Section A of [Annex I](/en/ai-act/annex-1), only the derogations established in that legislation apply.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n#### Article 46: Derogation from conformity assessment procedure\n\n##### 1. By way of derogation from [Article 43](/en/ai-act/article-43) and upon a duly justified request, any market surveillance authority may authorise the placing on the market or the putting into service of specific high-risk AI systems within the territory of the Member State concerned, for exceptional reasons of public security or the protection of life and health of persons, environmental protection or the protection of key industrial and infrastructural assets. That authorisation shall be for a limited period while the necessary conformity assessment procedures are being carried out, taking into account the exceptional reasons justifying the derogation. The completion of those procedures shall be undertaken without undue delay.\n\n##### 2. In a duly justified situation of urgency for exceptional reasons of public security or in the case of specific, substantial and imminent threat to the life or physical safety of natural persons, law-enforcement authorities or civil protection authorities may put a specific high-risk AI system into service without the authorisation referred to in paragraph 1, provided that such authorisation is requested during or after the use without undue delay. If the authorisation referred to in paragraph 1 is refused, the use of the high-risk AI system shall be stopped with immediate effect and all the results and outputs of such use shall be immediately discarded.\n\n##### 3. The authorisation referred to in paragraph 1 shall be issued only if the market surveillance authority concludes that the high-risk AI system complies with the requirements of Section 2. The market surveillance authority shall inform the Commission and the other Member States of any authorisation issued pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2. This obligation shall not cover sensitive operational data in relation to activities related to law-enforcement authorities.\n\n##### 4. Where, within 15 calendar days of receipt of the information referred to in paragraph 3, no objection has been raised by either a Member State or the Commission in respect of an authorisation issued by a market surveillance authority of a Member State in accordance with paragraph 1, that authorisation shall be deemed justified.\n\n##### 5. Where, within 15 calendar days of receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph 3, objections are raised by a Member State against an authorisation issued by a market surveillance authority of another Member State, or where the Commission considers the authorisation to be contrary to Union law, or认为作者化是违反欧盟法律，或者市场监督机构的结论被认为不成立，则该批准将被取消。\n\n##### 6. Where there was consultation under paragraph 3 following receipt by either a member state or under paragraph&nbsp;2 following notification,&nbsp;objections were raised against an approval issued by a&nbsp;market&nbsp;surveillance&nbsp;authority&nbsp;of another member state,&nbsp;a decision should be made about whether it is justified.&nbsp;The Commission should address its decision to both affected states and operators involved.\n\n##### 7\\.

Where a general-purpose AI model meets the condition referred to in [Article 51(1)](/en/ai-act/article-51), point (a), the relevant provider shall notify the Commission without delay and in any event within two weeks after that requirement is met or it becomes known that it will be met. That notification shall include the information necessary to demonstrate that the relevant requirement has been met. If the Commission becomes aware of a general-purpose AI model presenting systemic risks of which it has not been notified, it may decide to designate it as a model with systemic risk.**\n\n**2\\. The provider of a general-purpose AI model that meets the condition referred to in [Article 51(1)](/en/ai-act/article-51), point (a), may present, with its notification, sufficiently substantiated arguments to demonstrate that, exceptionally, although it meets that requirement, the general-purpose AI model does not present, due to its specific characteristics, systemic risks and therefore should not be classified as a general-purpose AI model with systemic risk.**\n\n**3\\. Where the Commission concludes that the arguments submitted pursuant to paragraph 2 are not sufficiently substantiated and the relevant provider was not able to demonstrate that the general-purpose AI model does not present, due to its specific characteristics, systemic risks, it shall reject those arguments, and the general-purpose AI model shall be considered to be a general-purpose AI model with systemic risk.**\n\n**4\\. The Commission may designate a general-purpose AI model as presenting systemic risks, ex officio or following a qualified alert from the scientific panel pursuant to [Article 90(1)](/en/ai-act/article-90), point (a), on the basis of criteria set out in [Annex XIII](/en/ai-act/annex-13).**\n\nThe Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with [Article 97](/en/ai-act/article-97) in order to amend [Annex XIII](/en/ai-act/annex-13) by specifying and updating the criteria set out in that Annex.\n\n**5\\. Upon a reasoned request of a provider whose model has been designated as a general-purpose AI model with systemic risk pursuant to paragraph 4, the Commission shall take the request into account and may decide to reassess whether the general-purpose AI model can still be considered to present systemic risks on the basis of the criteria set out in [Annex XIII](/en/ai-act/annex-13). Such a request shall contain objective, detailed and new reasons that have arisen since the designation decision. Providers may request reassessment at the earliest six months after the designation decision. Where the Commission, following its reassessment, decides to maintain the designation as a general-purpose AI model with systemic risk, providers may request reassessment at the earliest six months after that decision.**\n\n**6\\. The Commission shall ensure that a list of general-purpose AI models with systemic risk is published and shall keep that list up to date, without prejudice to the need to observe and protect intellectual property rights and confidential business information or trade secrets in accordance with Union and national law.**\n```", "fetched_at_utc": "2025-12-28T20:03:07Z", "sha256": "3e248a0624b768434f5f9773584b09c48f238a8bd6af1982d8352736552b786b", "meta": {"jina_status": 20000, "jina_code": 200, "description": null, "links": null, "images": null, "usage": {"tokens": 12000}}}

Irrespective of whether an AI system is placed on the market or put into service independently of the products referred to in points (a) and (b), that AI system shall be considered to be high-risk where both of the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n   - (a) the AI system is intended to be used as a safety component of a product, or the AI system is itself a product, covered by the Union harmonisation legislation listed in [Annex I](/en/ai-act/annex-1);\n   - (b) the product whose safety component pursuant to point (a) is the AI system, or the AI system itself as a product, is required to undergo a third-party conformity assessment, with a view to the placing on the market or the putting into service of that product pursuant to the Union harmonisation legislation listed in [Annex I](/en/ai-act/annex-1).\n\n2. In addition to the high-risk AI systems referred to in paragraph 1, AI systems referred to in [Annex III](/en/ai-act/annex-3) shall be considered to be high-risk.\n\n3. By derogation from paragraph 2, an AI system referred to in [Annex III](/en/ai-act/annex-3) shall not be considered to be high-risk where it does not pose a significant risk of harm to the health, safety or fundamental rights of natural persons, including by not materially influencing the outcome of decision making.\n\n   The first subparagraph shall apply where any of the following conditions is fulfilled:\n   \n   - (a) the AI system is intended to perform a narrow procedural task;\n   - (b) the AI system is intended to improve the result of a previously completed human activity;\n   - (c) the AI system is intended to detect decision-making patterns or deviations from prior decision-making patterns and is not meant to replace or influence the previously completed human assessment, without proper human review; or\n   - (d) the AI system is intended to perform a preparatory task to an assessment relevant for the purposes of the use cases listed in [Annex III](/en/ai-act/annex-3).\n\n   Notwithstanding the first subparagraph, an AI system referred to in [Annex III](/en/ai-act/annex-3) shall always be considered to be high-risk where the AI system performs profiling of natural persons.\n\n4. A provider who considers that an AI system referred to in [Annex III](/en/ai-act/annex-3) is not high-risk shall document its assessment before that system is placed on the market or put into service. Such provider shall be subject to the registration obligation set out in [Article 49(2)](/en/ai-act/article-49). Upon request of national competent authorities, the provider shall provide the documentation of the assessment.\n\n5. The Commission shall, after consulting the European Artificial Intelligence Board (the ‘Board’) and no later than 2 February 2026, provide guidelines specifying the practical implementation of this Article in line with [Article 96](/en/ai-act/article-96) together with a comprehensive list of practical examples of use cases of AI systems that are high-risk and not high-risk.\n\n6. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with [Article 97](/en/ai-act/article-97) in order to amend paragraph 3, second subparagraph, of this Article by adding new conditions to those laid down therein, or by modifying them, where there is concrete and reliable evidence of the existence of AI systems that fall under the scope of [Annex III](/en/ai-act/annex-3), but do not pose a significant risk of harm to the health, safety or fundamental rights of natural persons.\n\n7.

This system should be a continuous process throughout the high-risk AI system's lifecycle, regularly reviewed and updated. Risk management measures aim to eliminate or reduce risks through design, mitigation, and user information. Testing is required to ensure compliance and performance, with consideration for persons under the age of 18 and vulnerable groups. Providers can integrate these requirements with existing risk management processes under other EU laws.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n## Article 9: Risk management system\n\n### Step 1: Identify and analyze risks\n\nA risk management system shall be established, implemented, documented and maintained in relation to high-risk AI systems. The risk management system shall be understood as a continuous iterative process planned and run throughout the entire lifecycle of a high-risk AI system, requiring regular systematic review and updating. It shall comprise the following steps:\n\n- **(a)** The identification and analysis of the known and the reasonably foreseeable risks that the high-risk AI system can pose to health, safety or fundamental rights when the high-risk AI system is used in accordance with its intended purpose;\n- **(b)** The estimation and evaluation of the risks that may emerge when the high-risk AI system is used in accordance with its intended purpose, and under conditions of reasonably foreseeable misuse;\n- **(c)** The evaluation of other risks possibly arising, based on the analysis of data gathered from the post-market monitoring system referred to in [Article 72](/en/ai-act/article-72);\n- **(d)** The adoption of appropriate and targeted risk management measures designed to address the risks identified pursuant to point (a).\n\n### Step 2: Estimate and evaluate risks\n\nThe risks referred to in this Article shall concern only those which may be reasonably mitigated or eliminated through the development or design of the high-risk AI system, or the provision of adequate technical information.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate other risks\n\nThe risk management measures referred to in paragraph 2, point (d), shall give due consideration to the effects and possible interaction resulting from the combined application of the requirements set out in this Section, with a view to minimizing risks more effectively while achieving an appropriate balance in implementing the measures to fulfill those requirements.\n\n### Step 4: Adopt targeted measures\n\nThe risk management measures referred to in paragraph 2, point (d), shall be such that the relevant residual risk associated with each hazard, as well as the overall residual risk of the high-risk AI systems is judged to be acceptable.\n\nIn identifying the most appropriate risk management measures, the following shall be ensured:\n- Elimination or reduction of risks identified and evaluated pursuant to paragraph 2 in as far as technically feasible through adequate design and development of the high-risk AI system;\n- Where appropriate, implementation of adequate mitigation and control measures addressing risks that cannot be eliminated;\n- Provision of information required pursuant to [Article 13](/en/ai-act/article-13) and, where appropriate, training to deployers.\n\nWith a view to eliminating or reducing risks related to the use of the high-risk AI system, due consideration shall be given to technical knowledge, experience, education, the training to be expected by the deployer, and the presumable context in which the system is intended to be used.\n\n### Step 5: Test for compliance\n\nHigh-risk AI systems shall be tested for purposes of identifying appropriate and targeted risk management measures. Testing shall ensure that high-risk AI systems perform consistently for their intended purpose and that they are compliant with requirements set out in this Section.\n\nTesting procedures may include testing in real-world conditions in accordance with [Article 60](/en/ai-act/article-60).\n\n### Step 6: Perform testing throughout lifecycle\n\nWhen implementing a risk management system as provided for in paragraphs 1 to 7, providers shall consider whether in view of its intended purpose it is likely to have an adverse impact on persons under 18 or other vulnerable groups.\n\nFor providers of high-risk AI systems that are subject to requirements regarding internal risk management processes under other relevant provisions of Union law, aspects provided in paragraphs 1 to 9 may form part of or combine with risk management procedures established pursuant to those laws.\n\n## Relevant Recitals\n\n*   [Recital 64](/en/ai-act/recital-64)\n*   [Recital 65](/en/ai-act/recital-65)\n*   [Recital 71](/en/ai-act/recital-71)\n\nView official text: [Artificial Intelligence Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).\n```", "fetched_at_utc": "2025-12-28T20:11:44Z", "sha256": "207116602bd25b2630f851a215fe83e252db15050b4ebb4a5d96e7b93b8b220a", "meta": {"jina_status": 20000, "jina_code": 200, "description": null, "links": null, "images": null, "usage": {"tokens": 12000}}}

Oversight measures should be proportional to the system's risks, autonomy, and context of use, including built-in safeguards and deployer-implemented controls. Humans must be able to monitor, interpret, and override the system, with awareness of potential over-reliance on AI outputs. For remote biometric identification systems, critical decisions must be verified by at least two competent individuals, except in specific law enforcement or border control scenarios.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n1. High-risk AI systems shall be designed and developed in such a way, including with appropriate human-machine interface tools, that they can be effectively overseen by natural persons during the period in which they are in use.\n2. Human oversight shall aim to prevent or minimize the risks to health, safety or fundamental rights that may emerge when a high-risk AI system is used in accordance with its intended purpose or under conditions of reasonably foreseeable misuse, in particular where such risks persist despite the application of other requirements set out in this Section.\n3. The oversight measures shall be commensurate with the risks, level of autonomy and context of use of the high-risk AI system, and shall be ensured through either one or both of the following types of measures:\n   - measures identified and built into the high-risk AI system by the provider before it is placed on the market or put into service;\n   - measures identified by the provider before placing the high-risk AI system on the market or putting it into service and that are appropriate to be implemented by the deployer.\n4. For the purpose of implementing paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, the high-risk AI system shall be provided to the deployer in such a way that natural persons to whom human oversight is assigned are enabled, as appropriate and proportionate:\n   - properly understand the relevant capacities and limitations of the high-risk AI system and be able to duly monitor its operation, including in view of detecting and addressing anomalies, dysfunctions and unexpected performance;\n   - remain aware of the possible tendency of automatically relying or over-relying on the output produced by a high-risk AI system (automation bias), in particular for high-risk AI systems used to provide information or recommendations for decisions to be taken by natural persons;\n   - correctly interpret the high-risk AI system’s output, taking into account, for example, the interpretation tools and methods available;\n   - decide, in any particular situation, not to use the high-risk AI system or to otherwise disregard, override or reverse the output of the high-risk AI system;\n   - intervene in the operation of the high-risk AI system or interrupt the system through a ‘stop’ button or a similar procedure that allows the system to come to a halt in a safe state.\n5. For high-risk AI systems referred to in point 1(a) of [Annex III](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-3), the measures referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article shall be such as to ensure that no action or decision is taken by the deployer on the basis of an identification resulting from the system unless that identification has been separately verified and confirmed by at least two natural persons with necessary competence, training and authority.\n   The requirement for a separate verification by at least two natural persons shall not apply to high-risk AI systems used for purposes considered disproportionate due to law enforcement activities.\n\n### Relevant Recitals\n- [Recital 27](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-27)\n- [Recital 66](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-66)\n- [Recital 73](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-73)\n- [Recital 91](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-91)\n\nView official text: [Artificial Intelligence Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).\n```", "fetched_at_utc": "2025-12-28T20:13:35Z", "sha256": "6c0989f05ddcf70cf299823e69b5bb96303ec7b46918215cab907bbb9f1ae526", "meta": {"jina_status": 20000, "jina_code": 200, "description": null, "links": null, "images": null, "usage": {"tokens": 12000}}}

The technical documentation of the AI system shall be examined in accordance with point 4.\n\n## Quality Management System\n\n### 3.1 The application of the provider shall include:\n\n- (a) the name and address of the provider and, if the application is lodged by an authorised representative, also their name and address;\n- (b) the list of AI systems covered under the same quality management system;\n- (c) the technical documentation for each AI system covered under the same quality management system;\n- (d) the documentation concerning the quality management system which shall cover all the aspects listed under [Article 17](/en/ai-act/article-17);\n- (e) a description of the procedures in place to ensure that the quality management system remains adequate and effective;\n- (f) a written declaration that the same application has not been lodged with any other notified body.\n\n### 3.2 The quality management system shall be assessed by the notified body, which shall determine whether it satisfies the requirements referred to in [Article 17](/en/ai-act/article-17). The decision shall be notified to the provider or its authorised representative. The notification shall contain the conclusions of the assessment of the quality management system and the reasoned assessment decision.\n\n### 3.3 The quality management system as approved shall continue to be implemented and maintained by the provider so that it remains adequate and efficient.\n\n### 3.4 Any intended change to the approved quality management system or the list of AI systems covered by the latter shall be brought to the attention of the notified body by the provider. The proposed changes shall be examined by the notified body, which shall decide whether the modified quality management system continues to satisfy the requirements referred to in point 3.2 or whether an reassessment is necessary. The notified body shall notify the provider of its decision. The notification shall contain the conclusions of the examination of these changes and a reasoned assessment decision.\n\n## Control of Technical Documentation\n\n### 4.1 In addition to applying principles outlined in point 3, an application with a notified body should be lodged by a provider for assessing technical documentation relating to an AI system which is covered by a quality management system referred to under point 3.\n\n### 4.2 The application should include:\n- (a) details about who submitted it;\n- (b) a written declaration that no similar applications have been made with any other notified body;\n- (c) technical documentation provided according to [Annex IV](/en/ai-act/annex-4).\n\n### 4.3 Technical documentation must undergo examination by a notified body. If necessary, additional tests may need to be conducted.\n\n### 4.4 Examinations can be supplemented with further evidence or tests if deemed necessary due to limitations imposed by available resources.\n\n### 4.5 Where required for assessing high-risk AI systems, access can be granted without prior approval from another notified body but must adhere to existing Union law on intellectual property protection and trade secrets.\n\n### 4.6 Notifications regarding changes within organizations are mandatory when there's reason to believe they could affect compliance with legal requirements or their intended purpose.\n\n## Surveillance\n\n### 5.1 Surveillance aims at ensuring compliance with provisions mentioned in point 3 throughout implementation phases.\n\n### 5.2 Providers must allow inspections related to compliance assessments conducted by authorized bodies.\n\n### 5.3 Periodic audits are performed by authorized bodies to confirm ongoing adherence to approved quality frameworks and maintain effectiveness.\n\n## Assessments\n\n### Additional Actions After Passing Examination\n\nIf found compliant, authorization certificates will be issued following proper examination processes.\nIf not compliant, amendments may need additional examinations before issuing new certificates.\nChanges requiring new certifications might necessitate direct assessments from authorized bodies instead.\nIn cases where adjustments cannot resolve concerns, supplementary certification documents may need issuance.\nAdditional requests for access can lead to direct inspections from authorized bodies.\nCertification certificates will state details like identification numbers for future product tracking.\nUpon completion, certified products must comply fully with legal regulations.\n```", "fetched_at_utc": "2025-12-28T20:50:27Z", "sha256": "3c140374a8af5488dc397301bb1999c35542dae73a417d1d740cd4eff63de1bb", "meta": {"jina_status": 20000, "jina_code": 200, "description": null, "links": null, "images": null, "usage": {"tokens": 12000}}}

This includes testing services (certification), inspections etc., performed by third parties certified under this regulation and other relevant harmonized legislation providing means to comply with certain requirements established under this Regulation.\n\n### Definition 21: ‘Conformity Assessment Body’\n\n**Definition**: Third-party organization conducting tests related to conformity assessments. It must meet specific criteria outlined in Directive (EU) No. 2014/90/EU and Directive (EU) No. 2016/797 concerning artificial intelligence systems as defined hereunder. These organizations must be notified via Annex III before they can begin testing activities under this Regulation and other relevant harmonization legislation provisions requiring their registration status. They must also maintain confidentiality agreements with those involved in their testing activities while they are engaged in such activities. There are some exceptions where they can share confidential information among themselves without violating privacy laws because they are working together with another entity authorized by law to perform similar functions. They cannot disclose sensitive operational data unless specifically requested by law enforcement authorities acting within their jurisdictional limits. They should also ensure adequate safeguards against unauthorized access to protected data during testing activities conducted outside regulated areas like laboratories but outside real-world conditions where data collection occurs remotely without significant delays so as not to compromise investigations into crimes punishable by criminal sanctions. For example:\n\n* **Remote Biometric Identification Systems**\n* **Real-Time Remote Biometric Identification Systems**\n\nThese types include remote biometric identification systems where all steps occur without significant delays like instant identification combined with minimal short-term delays aimed at avoiding circumvention issues due to potential threats posed by criminals seeking evasion tactics when investigating crimes punishable by criminal sanctions. Real-time remote biometric identification systems require instant identification followed by minimal short-term delays rather than long-term delays associated with traditional laboratory-based approaches focusing solely on detecting suspicious patterns indicative of malicious activity prior to confirmation through additional checks beyond mere visual comparisons between captured biometrics from subjects compared against stored reference databases containing biometric profiles derived from previous participants participating voluntarily within controlled settings known as \"sandbox plans\". These types involve multiple stages starting with rapid identification followed by brief periods allowing investigators examining evidence gathered earlier during pre-testing phases conducted elsewhere away from typical operating environments often situated indoors near computer terminals connected online networks potentially facilitating illicit transactions facilitated through sophisticated techniques exploiting vulnerabilities inherent within digital ecosystems susceptible only when exploited successfully once identified accurately enough enabling successful deception leading ultimately towards financial gains achievable only through manipulation deceive others thereby evading justice thus posing severe threat undermining trust among citizens necessitating swift

It also outlaws certain AI systems used for individual criminal offence risk assessment and prediction based solely on profiling or personality traits and characteristics, untargeted scraping to develop facial recognition databases, emotion recognition and biometric categorization. Real-time remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces for the purposes of law enforcement is also prohibited with some exceptions.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n### 1\\. The following AI practices shall be prohibited:\n\n(a) the placing on the market, the putting into service or the use of an AI system that deploys subliminal techniques beyond a person’s consciousness or purposely manipulative or deceptive techniques, with the objective, or the effect of materially distorting the behavior of a person or a group of persons by appreciably impairing their ability to make an informed decision, thereby causing them to take a decision that they would not have otherwise taken in a manner that causes or is reasonably likely to cause that person, another person or group of persons significant harm;\n\n(b) the placing on the market, the putting into service or the use of an AI system that exploits any of the vulnerabilities of a natural person or a specific group of persons due to their age, disability or a specific social or economic situation, with the objective, or the effect, of materially distorting the behavior of that person or a person belonging to that group in a manner that causes or is reasonably likely to cause that person or another person significant harm;\n\n(c) the placing on the market, the putting into service or the use of an AI system for evaluating or classifying natural persons or groups of persons over a certain period of time based on their social behavior or known, inferred or predicted personal or personality characteristics, with social scores leading to either:\n   - detrimental or unfavorable treatment of certain natural persons or groups of persons in social contexts unrelated to those in which the data was originally generated or collected;\n   - detrimental or unfavorable treatment of certain natural persons or groups of persons that is unjustified or disproportionate to their social behavior and its gravity;\n\n(d) the placing on the market, putting into service for this specific purpose, or using an AI system for making risk assessments of natural persons in order to assess或predict risk levels associated with criminal offenses based solely on profiling individuals based on these profiles alone (which includes criminal offense risk assessment and prediction based solely on profiling). This prohibition does not apply to AI systems used to support human assessments involving individuals in criminal investigations and prosecutions while maintaining objective links between crimes directly linked to criminal acts.\n\n(e) placing on the market, putting into service for this specific purpose, using an AI system for making risk assessments regarding individuals' likelihood of committing crimes solely based on demographic factors (such as age).\n\n(f) placing on the market, putting into service for this specific purpose using an AI system for creating databases containing facial images obtained through untargeted scraping from online sources.\n\n(g) placing on the market, putting into service for this specific purpose using an AI system for inferring emotions from individuals without direct access to their behavioral patterns.\n\n(h) using 'real-time' remote biometric identification systems in public places primarily aimed at identifying victims of abduction, trafficking in humans, sexual exploitation cases (including missing people searches), preventing terrorist attacks (with a minimum detention period), and localizing suspects suspected of committing crimes punishable by at least four years imprisonment.\n\nPoint (h) applies only when necessary and proportionate measures are implemented during situations considered urgent.\n\n(i) The use must be authorized only if it is assessed as necessary and proportionate by law enforcement authorities after conducting fundamental rights impact assessments according to Article 27. These measures must ensure minimal disruption to citizens' rights and freedoms while addressing legitimate concerns about potential harms.\n\n(j) Using 'real-time' remote biometric identification systems exclusively for law enforcement purposes requires prior authorization granted by judicial authorities. In emergencies requiring immediate action without authorization approval within 24 hours can be initiated without authorization approval.\n\n(k) Each use must be reported annually via national markets surveillance authorities and national data protection authorities. Annual reports will include aggregated data from Member States but will exclude sensitive operational data.\n\n(l) This Article does not affect prohibitions applicable where an AI practice violates other Union laws.\n\n### Relevant Recitals\n\n* [Recital 3](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-3)\n* [Recital 26](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-26)\n* [Recital 28](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-28)\n* [Recital 29](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-29)\n* [Recital 30](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-30)\n* [Recital 31](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recrial-31)\n* [Recital 32](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recialt-32)\n* [Recital 33](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-atlrecialt-33)\n* [Recital 34](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/aiaatrecialt-34)\n* [Recital 35](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/aiaatrecialt--35)\n* [Recital 36](https://ai-actservice.deskc.com/en/aiaatrecialt--36)\n\n### Other Resources\n\n[Guidelines on prohibited AI practices](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-08/guidelines_on_prohibited_artificial_intelligence_practices_established_by_regulation_eu_20241689_ai_act_english_ied3r5nwo50xggpcfmwckm3nuc_112367.pdf)\n\nView the official text at: https://eur-legis.ejusticepro.net/juris/document.jsf?text=https%3A%2F%2Feur-legis.ejusticepro.net%2Fjuris%2Fdocument.jsf%3Ftext%3DEU-LAW%40EN&docid=OJ:L_202401689&doctype=TEXT&lang=en\n```", "fetched_at_utc": "2025-12-28T20:55:10Z", "sha256": "67b9782e55ecc74c2b86cb8704ed9fdc3cc462e52ac2b7deb3e478f111c1e68e", "meta": {"jina_status": 20000, "jina_code": 200, "description": null, "links": null, "images": null, "usage": {"tokens": 12000}}}

Irrespective of whether an AI system is placed on the market or put into service independently of the products referred to in points (a) and (b), that AI system shall be considered to be high-risk where both of the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n   - (a) the AI system is intended to be used as a safety component of a product, or the AI system is itself a product, covered by the Union harmonisation legislation listed in [Annex I](/en/ai-act/annex-1);\n   - (b) the product whose safety component pursuant to point (a) is the AI system, or the AI system itself as a product, is required to undergo a third-party conformity assessment, with a view to the placing on the market or the putting into service of that product pursuant to the Union harmonisation legislation listed in [Annex I](/en/ai-act/annex-1).\n\n2. In addition to the high-risk AI systems referred to in paragraph 1, AI systems referred to in [Annex III](/en/ai-act/annex-3) shall be considered to be high-risk.\n\n3. By derogation from paragraph 2, an AI system referred to in [Annex III](/en/ai-act/annex-3) shall not be considered to be high-risk where it does not pose a significant risk of harm to the health, safety or fundamental rights of natural persons, including by not materially influencing the outcome of decision making.\n\n   The first subparagraph shall apply where any of the following conditions is fulfilled:\n   \n   - (a) the AI system is intended to perform a narrow procedural task;\n   - (b) the AI system is intended to improve the result of a previously completed human activity;\n   - (c) the AI system is intended to detect decision-making patterns or deviations from prior decision-making patterns and is not meant to replace or influence the previously completed human assessment, without proper human review; or\n   - (d) the AI system is intended to perform a preparatory task to an assessment relevant for the purposes of the use cases listed in [Annex III](/en/ai-act/annex-3).\n\n   Notwithstanding the first subparagraph, an AI system referred to in [Annex III](/en/ai-act/annex-3) shall always be considered to be high-risk where the AI system performs profiling of natural persons.\n\n4. A provider who considers that an AI system referred to in [Annex III](/en/ai-act/annex-3) is not high-risk shall document its assessment before that system is placed on the market or put into service. Such provider shall be subject to the registration obligation set out in [Article 49(2)](/en/ai-act/article-49). Upon request of national competent authorities, the provider shall provide the documentation of the assessment.\n\n5. The Commission shall, after consulting the European Artificial Intelligence Board (the ‘Board’) and no later than 2 February 2026, provide guidelines specifying the practical implementation of this Article in line with [Article 96](/en/ai-act/article-96) together with a comprehensive list of practical examples of use cases of AI systems that are high-risk and not high-risk.\n\n6.

This system should be a continuous process throughout the high-risk AI system's lifecycle, regularly reviewed and updated. Risk management measures aim to eliminate or reduce risks through design, mitigation, and user information. Testing is required to ensure compliance and performance, with consideration for persons under the age of 18 and vulnerable groups. Providers can integrate these requirements with existing risk management processes under other EU laws.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n## Article 9: Risk management system\n\n### Step 1: Identify and analyze risks\n\nA risk management system shall be established, implemented, documented and maintained in relation to high-risk AI systems. The risk management system shall be understood as a continuous iterative process planned and run throughout the entire lifecycle of a high-risk AI system, requiring regular systematic review and updating. It shall comprise the following steps:\n\n- **(a)** The identification and analysis of the known and the reasonably foreseeable risks that the high-risk AI system can pose to health, safety or fundamental rights when the high-risk AI system is used in accordance with its intended purpose;\n- **(b)** The estimation and evaluation of the risks that may emerge when the high-risk AI system is used in accordance with its intended purpose, and under conditions of reasonably foreseeable misuse;\n- **(c)** The evaluation of other risks possibly arising, based on the analysis of data gathered from the post-market monitoring system referred to in [Article 72](/en/ai-act/article-72);\n- **(d)** The adoption of appropriate and targeted risk management measures designed to address the risks identified pursuant to point (a).\n\n### Step 2: Estimate and evaluate risks\n\nThe risks referred to in this Article shall concern only those which may be reasonably mitigated or eliminated through the development or design of the high-risk AI system, or the provision of adequate technical information.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate other risks\n\nThe risk management measures referred to in paragraph 2, point (d), shall give due consideration to the effects and possible interaction resulting from the combined application of the requirements set out in this Section, with a view to minimizing risks more effectively while achieving an appropriate balance in implementing the measures to fulfill those requirements.\n\n### Step 4: Adopt targeted measures\n\nThe risk management measures referred to in paragraph 2, point (d), shall be such that the relevant residual risk associated with each hazard, as well as the overall residual risk of the high-risk AI systems is judged to be acceptable.\n\nIn identifying the most appropriate risk management measures, the following shall be ensured:\n- Elimination or reduction of risks identified and evaluated pursuant to paragraph 2 in as far as technically feasible through adequate design and development of the high-risk AI system;\n- Where appropriate, implementation of adequate mitigation and control measures addressing risks that cannot be eliminated;\n- Provision of information required pursuant to [Article 13](/en/ai-act/article-13) and, where appropriate, training to deployers.\n\nWith a view to eliminating or reducing risks related to the use of the high-risk AI system, due consideration shall be given to technical knowledge, experience, education, the training to be expected by the deployer, and the presumable context in which the system is intended to be used.\n\n### Step 5: Test for compliance\n\nHigh-risk AI systems shall be tested for purposes of identifying appropriate and targeted risk management measures. Testing shall ensure that high-risk AI systems perform consistently for their intended purpose and that they are compliant with requirements set out in this Section.\n\nTesting procedures may include testing in real-world conditions in accordance with [Article 60](/en/ai-act/article-60).\n\n### Step 6: Perform testing throughout lifecycle\n\nWhen implementing a risk management system as provided for in paragraphs 1 to 7, providers shall consider whether in view of its intended purpose it is likely to have an adverse impact on persons under 18 or other vulnerable groups.\n\nFor providers of high-risk AI systems that are subject to requirements regarding internal risk management processes under other relevant provisions of Union law, aspects provided in paragraphs 1 to 9 may form part of or combine with risk management procedures established pursuant to those laws.\n\n## Relevant Recitals\n\n*   [Recital 64](/en/ai-act/recital-64)\n*   [Recital 65](/en/ai-act/recital-65)\n*   [Recital 71](/en/ai-act/recital-71)\n\nView official text: [Artificial Intelligence Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).\n```", "fetched_at_utc": "2025-12-28T20:56:53Z", "sha256": "207116602bd25b2630f851a215fe83e252db15050b4ebb4a5d96e7b93b8b220a", "meta": {"jina_status": 20000, "jina_code": 200, "description": null, "links": null, "images": null, "usage": {"tokens": 12000}}}

Oversight measures should be proportional to the system's risks, autonomy, and context of use, including built-in safeguards and deployer-implemented controls. Humans must be able to monitor, interpret, and override the system, with awareness of potential over-reliance on AI outputs. For remote biometric identification systems, critical decisions must be verified by at least two competent individuals, except in specific law enforcement or border control scenarios.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n1. High-risk AI systems shall be designed and developed in such a way, including with appropriate human-machine interface tools, that they can be effectively overseen by natural persons during the period in which they are in use.\n2. Human oversight shall aim to prevent or minimize the risks to health, safety or fundamental rights that may emerge when a high-risk AI system is used in accordance with its intended purpose or under conditions of reasonably foreseeable misuse, in particular where such risks persist despite the application of other requirements set out in this Section.\n3. The oversight measures shall be commensurate with the risks, level of autonomy and context of use of the high-risk AI system, and shall be ensured through either one or both of the following types of measures:\n   - measures identified and built into the high-risk AI system by the provider before it is placed on the market or put into service;\n   - measures identified by the provider before placing the high-risk AI system on the market or putting it into service and that are appropriate to be implemented by the deployer.\n4. For the purpose of implementing paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, the high-risk AI system shall be provided to the deployer in such a way that natural persons to whom human oversight is assigned are enabled, as appropriate and proportionate:\n   - properly understand the relevant capacities and limitations of the high-risk AI system and be able to duly monitor its operation, including in view of detecting and addressing anomalies, dysfunctions and unexpected performance;\n   - remain aware of the possible tendency of automatically relying or over-relying on the output produced by a high-risk AI system (automation bias), in particular for high-risk AI systems used to provide information or recommendations for decisions to be taken by natural persons;\n   - correctly interpret the high-risk AI system’s output, taking into account, for example, the interpretation tools and methods available;\n   - decide, in any particular situation, not to use the high-risk AI system or to otherwise disregard, override or reverse the output of the high-risk AI system;\n   - intervene in the operation of the high-risk AI system or interrupt the system through a ‘stop’ button or a similar procedure that allows the system to come to a halt in a safe state.\n5. For high-risk AI systems referred to in point 1(a) of [Annex III](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-3), the measures referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article shall be such as to ensure that no action or decision is taken by the deployer on the basis of an identification resulting from the system unless that identification has been separately verified and confirmed by at least two natural persons with necessary competence, training and authority.\n\nThe requirement for a separate verification by at least two natural persons shall not apply to high-risk AI systems used for purposes considered disproportionate due to law enforcement activities.\n\n### Relevant Recitals\n- [Recital 27](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-27)\n- [Recital 66](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-66)\n- [Recital 73](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-73)\n- [Recital 91](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-91)\n\nView official text: [Artificial Intelligence Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).\n```", "fetched_at_utc": "2025-12-28T20:59:06Z", "sha256": "57b6054d9ba9e8a41f648f14801fcfb0e2db6a29e81f10aa439f0593b0a57d48", "meta": {"jina_status": 20000, "jina_code": 200, "description": null, "links": null, "images": null, "usage": {"tokens": 12000}}}

Providers and third-party suppliers must agree on sharing necessary information and assistance to ensure compliance, except for open-source tools. Intellectual property rights and confidential information must be protected throughout these processes.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n## Article 25: Responsibilities along the AI value chain\n\n### Section 3: Obligations of Providers and Deployers of High-Risk AI Systems and Other Parties\n\n#### 1. Any distributor, importer, deployer or other third-party shall be considered to be a provider of a high-risk AI system for the purposes of this Regulation and shall be subject to the obligations of the provider under [Article 16](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-16), in any of the following circumstances:\n\n- (a) they put their name or trademark on a high-risk AI system already placed on the market or put into service, without prejudice to contractual arrangements stipulating that the obligations are otherwise allocated;\n- (b) they make a substantial modification to a high-risk AI system that has already been placed on the market or has already been put into service in such a way that it remains a high-risk AI system pursuant to [Article 6](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-6);\n- (c) they modify the intended purpose of an AI system, including a general-purpose AI system, which has not been classified as high-risk and has already been placed on the market or put into service in such a way that the AI system concerned becomes a high-risk AI system in accordance with [Article 6](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-6).\n\n#### 2. Where the circumstances referred to in paragraph 1 occur, the provider that initially placed the AI system on the market or put it into service shall no longer be considered to be a provider of that specific AI system for the purposes of this Regulation. That initial provider shall closely cooperate with new providers and shall make available the necessary information and provide the reasonably expected technical access and other assistance that are required for the fulfillment of the obligations set out in this Regulation, in particular regarding compliance with the conformity assessment of high-risk AI systems. This paragraph shall not apply in cases where the initial provider has clearly specified that its AI system is not to be changed into a high-risk AI system and therefore does not fall under the obligation to hand over documentation.\n\n#### 3. In the case of high-risk AI systems that are safety components of products covered by the Union harmonization legislation listed in Section A of [Annex I](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-1), the product manufacturer shall be considered to be the provider of the high-risk AI system, and shall be subject to the obligations under [Article 16](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-16) under either of the following circumstances:\n\n- (a)the high-risk AI system is placed on the market together with the product under the name or trademark of the product manufacturer;\n- (b)the high-risk AI system is put into service under the name or trademark of the product manufacturer after the product has been placed on sale.\n\n#### 4. The provider of a high-risk AI system and third party that supplies an AI system, tools, services, components, or processes that are used or integrated in a high-risk AI system shall by written agreement specify necessary information capabilities technical access and other assistance based on generally acknowledged state-of-the-art in order to enable full compliance with obligations set out in this Regulation. This paragraph shall not apply to third parties making accessible to public tools services processes components other than general-purpose AI models under free and open-source license.\n\nThe **AI Office** may develop and recommend voluntary model terms for contracts between providers高风险人工智能系统和第三方供应商，以确保提供商能够完全遵守本法规的义务。这些自愿模型条款应遵循一般公认的行业标准，在具体领域或业务场景中考虑可能适用的合同要求。自愿模型条款应在免费、易于使用的电子格式下发布并供公众下载。\n\n#### 5.

They must manage input data, keep logs for at least six months, and inform providers and authorities of any risks or incidents. Deployers must also notify workers’ representatives and the affected workers if the system is used in the workplace. Public authorities deploying high-risk AI systems must comply with registration obligations (see [Article 49](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-49)) and ensure the system is registered in the EU database. Deployers must inform individuals subject to AI-assisted decisions and cooperate with authorities on regulatory actions.\n\nLaw enforcement authorities using high-risk AI system for post-remote biometric identification in targeted searches shall obtain authorisation in advance or not later than within 48 hours, save some exceptions. Each use must be documented, and annual reports submitted to authorities. \n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n1. Deployers of high-risk AI systems shall take appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure they use such systems in accordance with the instructions for use accompanying the systems, pursuant to paragraphs 3 and 6.\n2. Deployers shall assign human oversight to natural persons who have the necessary competence, training and authority, as well as the necessary support.\n3. The obligations set out in paragraphs 1 and 2, are without prejudice to other deployer obligations under Union or national law and to the deployer’s freedom to organise its own resources and activities for the purpose of implementing the human oversight measures indicated by the provider.\n4. Without prejudice to paragraphs 1 and 2, to the extent the deployer exercises control over the input data, that deployer shall ensure that input data is relevant and sufficiently representative in view of the intended purpose of the high-risk AI system.\n5. Deployers shall monitor the operation of the high-risk AI system on the basis of the instructions for use and, where relevant, inform providers in accordance with [Article 72](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-72). Where deployers have reason to consider that the use of the high-risk AI system in accordance with the instructions may result in that AI system presenting a risk within the meaning of [Article 79(1)](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-79), they shall, without undue delay, inform the provider or distributor and the relevant market surveillance authority, and shall suspend the use of that system. Where deployers have identified a serious incident, they shall also immediately inform first the provider, and then the importer or distributor and the relevant market surveillance authorities of that incident. If the deployer is not able to reach the provider, [Article 73](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-73) shall apply _mutatis mutandis_. This obligation shall not cover sensitive operational data of deployers of AI systems which are law enforcement authorities.\n\nFor deployers that are financial institutions subject to requirements regarding their internal governance, arrangements or processes under Union financial services law, the monitoring obligation set out in paragraph 5 shall be deemed to be fulfilled by complying with rules on internal governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms pursuant to relevant financial service law.\n\n6. Deployers of high-risk AI systems shall keep the logs automatically generated by that high-risk AI system to a period appropriate for its intended purpose of use, for at least six months unless provided otherwise in applicable Union or national law, particularly in Union law on personal data protection.\n\nDeployers that are financial institutions subject to requirements regarding their internal governance arrangements processes under Union financial services law shall maintain these logs as part of their documentation kept pursuant to relevant Union financial service law.\n\n7. Before putting into service or using a high-risk AI system at workstations employed by employees (employing companies), deployors who employ employees shall inform them about being subject to this system's usage. This information should be provided according to existing rules on employee information concerning labor relations.\n\n8. Deployers who are public authorities or entities under Union law governing communications networks content technology (Connect Directorate-General) shall comply with registration obligations referred to in [Article 49](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-49). When such entities find that a new high-risk AI system proposed for use has not been registered in Annex III (the list), they cannot utilize that system until authorization is obtained through judicial authority or administrative authority whose decision is legally binding subject to judicial review.\n\n9. Where applicable, entities deploying high-risk AI systems can access information provided under [Article 13](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-13) regarding compliance with data protection impact assessments required under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or Directive (EU) 2016/680.\n\n10. Without prejudice to Directive (EU) 2016/680 (for processing biometric data), when employing a post remote biometric identification system linked directly back-to-back with an authorised authorisation request from a judicial authority or administrative authority whose decision is legally binding subject to judicial review for targeted search purposes:\n\n   - The entity does not need an explicit authorisation per se.\n   - However prior approval from a judicial authority or administrative authority whose decision is legally binding subject to judicial review is required before starting up this kind of biometric identification process.\n   - Once started up this kind of biometric identification process requires ongoing authorization from either judicial authority or administrative authority whose decision is legally binding subject to judicial review.\n   \n   If approved authorization requests were rejected during this process:\n   \n   - The biometric identification process would stop immediately,\n   - Personal data associated with this biometric identification process would be deleted,\n   \n   These restrictions do not apply when using post remote biometric identification systems for law enforcement purposes authorized under Directive (EU) 2016/680.\n\n   **Note:** Such post remote biometric identification systems could only be used if there was sufficient evidence linking it directly back-to-back with an authorised authorisation request from a judicial authority or administrative authority whose decision was legally binding subject to judicial review.\n\n   **Additional Note:** Biometrics data collected via such post remote biometric identification systems would still need special treatment according to Directive (EU) 2016/680 regarding personal data protection.\n\n   Regardless of whether an entity employs a post remote biometric identification system linked directly back-to-back with an authorised authorisation request from a judicial authority or administrative authority whose decision was legally binding subject to judicial review:\n\n   - All uses involving such post remote biometric identification systems must be documented,\n     - And reported annually,\n     - To both local supervisory authorities responsible for handling personal data issues,\n     - And subsequently submitted electronically via online portal established by Connect Directorate-General,\n\n   Members states may establish additional regulations on how such post remote biometric identification systems can be utilized.\n\n11. Without prejudice to Recital 84 referring \"High-Risk\" applications,\" entities deploying high risk applications referred herein should inform users about their usage before placing them into service at workplaces.\" This information should follow existing procedures established by national laws on employee information concerning labor relations.\"\n\n12. Entities deploying high risk applications referred herein should cooperate with local supervisory authorities involved in any investigations conducted against them related specifically towards \"high risk\" applications.\"\n\n### Relevant recitals\n\n* [Recital 84](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-84)\n* [Recital 91](https://ai-act-service-desk.ecEuropEaLiNcE.en)\n* [Recital 92](https://aiActServiceDesk.EuropEaLiNcE.en)\n* [Recital 93](https://aiActServiceDesk.EuropEaLiNcE.en)\n* [Recital 95](https://aiActServiceDesk.EuropEaLiNcE.en)\n* [Recital 96](https://aiActServiceDesk.EuropEaLiNcE.en)\n* [Recital 134](https://aiActServiceDesk.EuropEaLiNcE.en)\n* [Recital 136](https://aiActServiceDesk.EuropEaLiNcE.en)\n* [Recital 143](https://aiActServiceDesk.EuropEaLiNcE.en)\n\nView\n```", "fetched_at_utc": "2025-12-28T21:04:05Z", "sha256": "f280b3286b365c1237a49d24d941f987d41d7528b8d022bfda463460485cb37e", "meta": {"jina_status": 20000, "jina_code": 200, "description": null, "links": null, "images": null, "usage": {"tokens": 12000}}}

This assessment is required for the first use and must be updated if changes occur. Deployers must notify authorities of the results using a provided template, unless exempt. The assessment complements existing data protection impact assessments.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n1. Prior to deploying a high-risk AI system referred to in [Article 6(2)](/en/ai-act/article-6), with the exception of high-risk AI systems intended to be used in the area listed in point 2 of [Annex III](/en/ai-act/annex-3), deployers that are bodies governed by public law, or are private entities providing public services, and deployers of high-risk AI systems referred to in points 5 (b) and (c) of [Annex III](/en/ai-act/annex-3), shall perform an assessment of the impact on fundamental rights that the use of such system may produce. For that purpose, deployers shall perform an assessment consisting of:\n\n   - a description of the deployer’s processes in which the high-risk AI system will be used in line with its intended purpose;\n   - a description of the period of time within which, and the frequency with which, each high-risk AI system is intended to be used;\n   - the categories of natural persons and groups likely to be affected by its use in the specific context;\n   - the specific risks of harm likely to have an impact on the categories of natural persons or groups of persons identified pursuant to point (c) of this paragraph, taking into account the information given by the provider pursuant to [Article 13](/en/ai-act/article-13);\n   - a description of the implementation of human oversight measures, according to the instructions for use;\n   - the measures to be taken in the case of the materialisation of those risks, including the arrangements for internal governance and complaint mechanisms.\n\n2. The obligation laid down in paragraph 1 applies to the first use of the high-risk AI system. The deployer may, in similar cases, rely on previously conducted fundamental rights impact assessments or existing impact assessments carried out by provider. If, during the use of the high-risk AI system, the deployer considers that any of the elements listed in paragraph 1 has changed or is no longer up to date, the deployer shall take the necessary steps to update the information.\n\n3. Once the assessment referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article has been performed, the deployer shall notify the market surveillance authority of its results, submitting the filled-out template referred to in paragraph 5 of this Article as part of the notification. In the case referred to in [Article 46(1)](/en/ai-act/article-46), deployers may be exempt from that obligation to notify.\n\n4. If any of the obligations laid down in this Article is already met through the data protection impact assessment conducted pursuant to [Article 35](/en/ai-act/article-35) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or [Article 27](/en/ai-act/article-27) of Directive (EU) 2016/680, the fundamental rights impact assessment referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall complement that data protection impact assessment.\n\n5.

It also outlaws certain AI systems used for individual criminal offence risk assessment and prediction based solely on profiling or personality traits and characteristics, untargeted scraping to develop facial recognition databases, emotion recognition and biometric categorization. Real-time remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces for the purposes of law enforcement is also prohibited with some exceptions.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n### 1\\. The following AI practices shall be prohibited:\n\n(a) the placing on the market, the putting into service or the use of an AI system that deploys subliminal techniques beyond a person’s consciousness or purposely manipulative or deceptive techniques, with the objective, or the effect of materially distorting the behavior of a person or a group of persons by appreciably impairing their ability to make an informed decision, thereby causing them to take a decision that they would not have otherwise taken in a manner that causes or is reasonably likely to cause that person, another person or group of persons significant harm;\n\n(b) the placing on the market, the putting into service or the use of an AI system that exploits any of the vulnerabilities of a natural person or a specific group of persons due to their age, disability or a specific social or economic situation, with the objective, or the effect, of materially distorting the behavior of that person or a person belonging to that group in a manner that causes or is reasonably likely to cause that person or another person significant harm;\n\n(c) the placing on the market, the putting into service or the use of an AI system for evaluating or classifying natural persons or groups of persons over a certain period of time based on their social behavior or known, inferred or predicted personal or personality characteristics, with social scores leading to either:\n   - detrimental or unfavorable treatment of certain natural persons or groups of persons in social contexts unrelated to those in which the data was originally generated or collected;\n   - detrimental or unfavorable treatment of certain natural persons or groups of persons that is unjustified or disproportionate to their social behavior and its gravity;\n\n(d) the placing on the market, putting into service for this specific purpose, or using an AI system for making risk assessments of natural persons in order to assess或predict risk levels associated with criminal offenses based solely on profiling individuals based on these profiles alone (which involves subjective interpretation rather than direct links between data generation and crime).\n\n(e) placing on the market, putting into service for this specific purpose, using an AI system for making risk assessments based solely on profiling individuals based solely on these profiles alone (which involves subjective interpretation rather than direct links between data generation and crime);\n\n(f) using 'real-time' remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes for any objective listed in paragraph 1(h). This includes targeting searches for missing people who have gone missing after being abducted, trafficked in humans, sexually exploited children etc., preventing terrorist attacks via location tracking technology (if authorized), localizing suspects suspected of committing crimes within police jurisdictions. These uses must be strictly necessary and proportionate.\n\n#### Point (h) refers to:\n- Targeted searches for missing people who have gone missing after being abducted,\n- Prevention against terrorist acts through location tracking technology,\n- Localizing suspects suspected of committing crimes within police jurisdictions.\n\n(g) Using 'real-time' remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes for any objective listed in paragraph 1(h). This includes targeting searches for missing people who have gone missing after being abducted,\n- Prevention against terrorist acts through location tracking technology,\n- Localizing suspects suspected of committing crimes within police jurisdictions.\n\n#### Note:\nPoint (h) applies only when it is necessary and proportionate to achieve one of paragraph 1's goals listed above.\n\n### 2\\. The use of 'real-time' remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes can be authorized only if:\n(a) it is strictly necessary and proportionate;\n(b) it meets necessary safeguards and conditions regarding temporal limits;\n(c) it complies with mandatory restrictions regarding geographic scope;\n(d) it ensures transparency about how data is processed;\n(e) it provides adequate protection against privacy breaches.\n\n### 3\\. Each use requires prior authorization granted by a judicial authority. Authorization can be revoked if there are insufficient grounds.\n\n### 4\\. Notifications should be submitted annually by member states and national market surveillance authorities.

Irrespective of whether an AI system is placed on the market or put into service independently of the products referred to in points (a) and (b), that AI system shall be considered to be high-risk where both of the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n   - (a) the AI system is intended to be used as a safety component of a product, or the AI system is itself a product, covered by the Union harmonisation legislation listed in [Annex I](/en/ai-act/annex-1);\n   - (b) the product whose safety component pursuant to point (a) is the AI system, or the AI system itself as a product, is required to undergo a third-party conformity assessment, with a view to the placing on the market or the putting into service of that product pursuant to the Union harmonisation legislation listed in [Annex I](/en/ai-act/annex-1).\n\n2. In addition to the high-risk AI systems referred to in paragraph 1, AI systems referred to in [Annex III](/en/ai-act/annex-3) shall be considered to be high-risk.\n\n3. By derogation from paragraph 2, an AI system referred to in [Annex III](/en/ai-act/annex-3) shall not be considered to be high-risk where it does not pose a significant risk of harm to the health, safety or fundamental rights of natural persons, including by not materially influencing the outcome of decision making.\n\n   The first subparagraph shall apply where any of the following conditions is fulfilled:\n   \n   - (a) the AI system is intended to perform a narrow procedural task;\n   - (b) the AI system is intended to improve the result of a previously completed human activity;\n   - (c) the AI system is intended to detect decision-making patterns or deviations from prior decision-making patterns and is not meant to replace or influence the previously completed human assessment, without proper human review; or\n   - (d) the AI system is intended to perform a preparatory task to an assessment relevant for the purposes of the use cases listed in [Annex III](/en/ai-act/annex-3).\n\n   Notwithstanding the first subparagraph, an AI system referred to in [Annex III](/en/ai-act/annex-3) shall always be considered to be high-risk where the AI system performs profiling of natural persons.\n\n4. A provider who considers that an AI system referred to in [Annex III](/en/ai-act/annex-3) is not high-risk shall document its assessment before that system is placed on the market or put into service. Such provider shall be subject to the registration obligation set out in [Article 49(2)](/en/ai-act/article-49). Upon request of national competent authorities, the provider shall provide the documentation of the assessment.\n\n5. The Commission shall, after consulting the European Artificial Intelligence Board (the ‘Board’) and no later than 2 February 2026, provide guidelines specifying the practical implementation of this Article in line with [Article 96](/en/ai-act/article-96) together with a comprehensive list of practical examples of use cases of AI systems that are high-risk and not high-risk.\n\n6.

This system should be a continuous process throughout the high-risk AI system's lifecycle, regularly reviewed and updated. Risk management measures aim to eliminate or reduce risks through design, mitigation, and user information. Testing is required to ensure compliance and performance, with consideration for persons under the age of 18 and vulnerable groups. Providers can integrate these requirements with existing risk management processes under other EU laws.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n## Article 9: Risk management system\n\n### Step 1: Identify and analyze risks\n\nA risk management system shall be established, implemented, documented and maintained in relation to high-risk AI systems. The risk management system shall be understood as a continuous iterative process planned and run throughout the entire lifecycle of a high-risk AI system, requiring regular systematic review and updating. It shall comprise the following steps:\n\n- **(a)** The identification and analysis of the known and the reasonably foreseeable risks that the high-risk AI system can pose to health, safety or fundamental rights when the high-risk AI system is used in accordance with its intended purpose;\n- **(b)** The estimation and evaluation of the risks that may emerge when the high-risk AI system is used in accordance with its intended purpose, and under conditions of reasonably foreseeable misuse;\n- **(c)** The evaluation of other risks possibly arising, based on the analysis of data gathered from the post-market monitoring system referred to in [Article 72](/en/ai-act/article-72);\n- **(d)** The adoption of appropriate and targeted risk management measures designed to address the risks identified pursuant to point (a).\n\n### Step 2: Estimate and evaluate risks\n\nThe risks referred to in this Article shall concern only those which may be reasonably mitigated or eliminated through the development or design of the high-risk AI system, or the provision of adequate technical information.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate other risks\n\nThe risk management measures referred to in paragraph 2, point (d), shall give due consideration to the effects and possible interaction resulting from the combined application of the requirements set out in this Section, with a view to minimizing risks more effectively while achieving an appropriate balance in implementing the measures to fulfill those requirements.\n\n### Step 4: Adopt targeted measures\n\nThe risk management measures referred to in paragraph 2, point (d), shall be such that the relevant residual risk associated with each hazard, as well as the overall residual risk of the high-risk AI systems is judged to be acceptable.\n\nIn identifying the most appropriate risk management measures, the following shall be ensured:\n- Elimination or reduction of risks identified and evaluated pursuant to paragraph 2 in as far as technically feasible through adequate design and development of the high-risk AI system;\n- Where appropriate, implementation of adequate mitigation and control measures addressing risks that cannot be eliminated;\n- Provision of information required pursuant to [Article 13](/en/ai-act/article-13) and, where appropriate, training to deployers.\n\nWith a view to eliminating or reducing risks related to the use of the high-risk AI system, due consideration shall be given to technical knowledge, experience, education, the training to be expected by the deployer, and the presumable context in which the system is intended to be used.\n\n### Step 5: Test for compliance\n\nHigh-risk AI systems shall be tested for purposes of identifying appropriate and targeted risk management measures.

If a notified body decides to stop its conformity assessment activities, it must inform the notifying authority and affected providers immediately, and, in case of planned cessation, at least one year before ceasing operations. The notified body's certificates can remain valid for nine months after it stops, provided another notified body agrees to take over responsibility for the high-risk AI systems. If a notified body no longer meets requirements, the notifying authority will investigate and may restrict, suspend, or withdraw its designation, informing the Commission and other Member States. The notified body must then inform providers within 10 days. The notifying authority will assess the impact on issued certificates, submit a report, and ensure that unduly issued certificates are suspended or withdrawn. Certificates remain valid under certain conditions during suspension, restriction, or withdrawal, with another notified body assuming responsibility if needed.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n## Section 4: Notifying Authorities and Notified Bodies\n\n### Article 36: Changes to notifications\n\n#### Summary\n\nNotifying authorities must inform the Commission and the other Member States of any relevant changes to the notification of a notified body via the electronic notification tool referred to in [Article 30(2)](/en/ai-act/article-30).\n\n#### Paragraphs\n\n1. The notifying authority shall notify the Commission and the other Member States of any relevant changes to the notification of a notified body via the electronic notification tool referred to in [Article 30(2)](/en/ai-act/article-30).\n   \n2. The procedures laid down in Articles 29 and 30 shall apply to extensions of the scope of the notification.\n   For changes to the notification other than extensions of its scope, the procedures laid down in paragraphs (3) to (9) shall apply.\n   \n3. Where a notified body decides to cease its conformity assessment activities, it shall inform the notifying authority and the providers concerned as soon as possible and, in the case of a planned cessation, at least one year before ceasing its activities. The certificates of the notified body may remain valid for a period of nine months after cessation of the notified body’s activities, on condition that another notified body has confirmed in writing that it will assume responsibilities for the high-risk AI systems covered by those certificates. The latter notified body shall complete a full assessment of the high-risk AI systems affected by the end of that nine-month-period before issuing new certificates for those systems. Where the notified body has ceased its activity, the notifying authority shall withdraw the designation.\n   \n4. Where a notifying authority has sufficient reason to consider that a notified body no longer meets the requirements laid down in [Article 31](/en/ai-act/article-31), or that it is failing to fulfill its obligations, the notifying authority shall without delay investigate the matter with utmost diligence. In that context, it shall inform the notified body concerned about the objections raised and give it the possibility to make its views known. If the notifying authority comes to conclude that:\n   - (a) The notified body no longer meets requirements laid down in [Article 31](/en/ai-act/article-31) or fails to fulfill obligations.\n   - (b) There is no risk to health, safety or fundamental rights associated with certificates affected by suspension or restriction.\n   - (c) Another qualified notified body assumes immediate responsibility for high-risk AI systems covered by certificates affected by suspension or restriction.\n   Then:\n   - (i) It assesses impact on issued certificates;\n   - (ii) It submits report on findings within three months;\n   - (iii) It requires certified bodies whose unduly issued certificates need correction;\n   - (iv) It informs Commission and Member States about certificates requiring suspension or withdrawal;\n   - (v) It provides national competent authorities with information about certificates affected by suspension or withdrawal.\n   \n5. Where its designation has been suspended, restricted, or fully or partially withdrawn,通知体（Notifyee）应立即通知委内瑞拉和其它成员国。委内瑞拉应迅速调查并确定是否需要暂停、限制或撤销其编号，必要时采取相应行动。\n6. 在终止或被禁用的决定中，通知体（Notifyee）应及时告知委内瑞拉和提供服务的提供商，并在计划停止运营至少一年后立即进行此操作。如果委托人希望提前结束业务，则应在停止运营之前一个月提出申请。证书将保留九个月，前提是另一通知机构同意承担高风险人工智能系统的责任。如果通知机构不再满足要求，它将审查情况并评估对证书的影响，提交报告，并确保未违规发出的证书不会继续发布。证书的有效期将在恢复运作期间延长至最多三年。\n7. 委员会可随时检查通知机构及其提供的服务的质量与合规性。\n\n### Relevant Recitals\n\n* [Recital 126](/en/ai-act/recital-126)\n\nView [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).

That authorisation shall be for a limited period while the necessary conformity assessment procedures are being carried out. In urgent situations, law enforcement or civil protection authorities may put high-risk AI systems into service without prior authorisation, but must request authorisation promptly.\n\nThe market surveillance authority is required to inform the Commission and other Member States of such authorisations. The authorisation is valid if the AI system complies with regulatory requirements and no objections are raised within 15 days. If objections are raised, the Commission will consult with the relevant Member State and operators to decide if the authorisation is justified. If deemed unjustified, the authorisation will be withdrawn. For AI systems covered by existing EU legislation listed in Section A of [Annex I](/en/ai-act/annex-1), only the derogations established in that legislation apply.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n#### Article 46: Derogation from conformity assessment procedure\n\n##### 1. By way of derogation from [Article 43](/en/ai-act/article-43) and upon a duly justified request, any market surveillance authority may authorise the placing on the market or the putting into service of specific high-risk AI systems within the territory of the Member State concerned, for exceptional reasons of public security or the protection of life and health of persons, environmental protection or the protection of key industrial and infrastructural assets. That authorisation shall be for a limited period while the necessary conformity assessment procedures are being carried out, taking into account the exceptional reasons justifying the derogation. The completion of those procedures shall be undertaken without undue delay.\n\n##### 2. In a duly justified situation of urgency for exceptional reasons of public security or in the case of specific, substantial and imminent threat to the life or physical safety of natural persons, law-enforcement authorities or civil protection authorities may put a specific high-risk AI system into service without the authorisation referred to in paragraph 1, provided that such authorisation is requested during or after the use without undue delay. If the authorisation referred to in paragraph 1 is refused, the use of the high-risk AI system shall be stopped with immediate effect and all the results and outputs of such use shall be immediately discarded.\n\n##### 3. The authorisation referred to in paragraph 1 shall be issued only if the market surveillance authority concludes that the high-risk AI system complies with the requirements of Section 2. The market surveillance authority shall inform the Commission and the other Member States of any authorisation issued pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2. This obligation shall not cover sensitive operational data in relation to activities related to law-enforcement authorities.\n\n##### 4. Where, within 15 calendar days of receipt of the information referred to in paragraph 3, no objection has been raised by either a Member State or the Commission in respect of an authorisation issued by a market surveillance authority of a Member State in accordance with paragraph 1, that authorisation shall be deemed justified.\n\n##### 5. Where, within 15 calendar days of receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph 3, objections are raised by a Member State against an authorisation issued by a market surveillance authority of another Member State, or where the Commission considers the authorisation to be contrary to Union law, or认为作者化是违反欧盟法律，或者市场监督机构的结论被认为不成立，则该批准将被取消。\n\n##### 6. Where there was consultation under paragraph 3 following receipt by either a member state or under paragraph&nbsp;2 following notification,&nbsp;objections were raised against an approval issued by a&nbsp;market&nbsp;surveillance&nbsp;authority&nbsp;of another member state,&nbsp;a decision should be made about whether it is justified.&nbsp;The Commission should address its decision to both affected states and operators involved.\n\n##### 7\\.

Providers can request a reassessment of the designation, but only after six months and with new evidence.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n1. Where a general-purpose AI model meets the condition referred to in [Article 51(1)](/en/ai-act/article-51), point (a), the relevant provider shall notify the Commission without delay and in any event within two weeks after that requirement is met or it becomes known that it will be met. That notification shall include the information necessary to demonstrate that the relevant requirement has been met. If the Commission becomes aware of a general-purpose AI model presenting systemic risks of which it has not been notified, it may decide to designate it as a model with systemic risk.\n\n2. The provider of a general-purpose AI model that meets the condition referred to in [Article 51(1)](/en/ai-act/article-51), point (a), may present, with its notification, sufficiently substantiated arguments to demonstrate that, exceptionally, although it meets that requirement, the general-purpose AI model does not present, due to its specific characteristics, systemic risks and therefore should not be classified as a general-purpose AI model with systemic risk.\n\n3. Where the Commission concludes that the arguments submitted pursuant to paragraph 2 are not sufficiently substantiated and the relevant provider was not able to demonstrate that the general-purpose AI model does not present, due to its specific characteristics, systemic risks, it shall reject those arguments, and the general-purpose AI model shall be considered to be a general-purpose AI model with systemic risk.\n\n4. The Commission may designate a general-purpose AI model as presenting systemic risks, ex officio or following a qualified alert from the scientific panel pursuant to [Article 90(1)](/en/ai-act/article-90), point (a), on the basis of criteria set out in [Annex XIII](/en/ai-act/annex-13).\n\n   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with [Article 97](/en/ai-act/article-97) in order to amend [Annex XIII](/en/ai-act/annex-13) by specifying and updating the criteria set out in that Annex.\n\n5. Upon a reasoned request of a provider whose model has been designated as a general-purpose AI model with systemic risk pursuant to paragraph 4, the Commission shall take the request into account and may decide to reassess whether the general-purpose AI model can still be considered to present systemic risks on the basis of the criteria set out in [Annex XIII](/en/ai-act/annex-13). Such a request shall contain objective, detailed and new reasons that have arisen since the designation decision. Providers may request reassessment at the earliest six months after the designation decision. Where the Commission, following its reassessment, decides to maintain the designation as a general-purpose AI model with systemic risk, providers may request reassessment at the earliest six months after that decision.\n\n6.

These sandboxes provide a controlled environment for developing and testing innovative AI systems before market release. They aim to improve legal certainty, foster innovation, and support regulatory compliance. Competent authorities will offer guidance and supervision, and providers can use sandbox activities to demonstrate compliance. Authorities must inform the AI Office about sandbox establishments and submit annual reports on progress and outcomes.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n1. Member States shall ensure that their competent authorities establish at least one AI regulatory sandbox at national level, which shall be operational by 2 August 2026. That sandbox may also be established jointly with the competent authorities of other Member States. The Commission may provide technical support, advice and tools for the establishment and operation of AI regulatory sandboxes.\n\n   The obligation under the first subparagraph may also be fulfilled by participating in an existing sandbox in so far as that participation provides an equivalent level of national coverage for the participating Member States.\n\n2. Additional AI regulatory sandboxes at regional or local level, or established jointly with the competent authorities of other Member States may also be established.\n\n3. The European Data Protection Supervisor may also establish an AI regulatory sandbox for Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, and may exercise the roles and the tasks of national competent authorities in accordance with this Chapter.\n\n4. Member States shall ensure that the competent authorities referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 allocate sufficient resources to comply with this Article effectively and in a timely manner. Where appropriate, national competent authorities shall cooperate with other relevant authorities, and may allow for the involvement of other actors within the AI ecosystem. This Article shall not affect other regulatory sandboxes established under Union or national law. Member States shall ensure an appropriate level of cooperation between the authorities supervising those other sandboxes and the national competent authorities.\n\n5. AI regulatory sandboxes established under paragraph 1 shall provide for a controlled environment that fosters innovation and facilitates the development, training, testing and validation of innovative AI systems for a limited time before their being placed on the market or put into service pursuant to a specific sandbox plan agreed between the providers or prospective providers and the competent authority. Such sandboxes may include testing in real world conditions supervised therein.\n\n6. Competent authorities shall provide, as appropriate, guidance, supervision and support within the AI regulatory sandbox with a view to identifying risks, in particular to fundamental rights, health and safety, testing, mitigation measures, and their effectiveness in relation to the obligations and requirements of this Regulation and, where relevant, other Union and national law supervised within the sandbox.\n\n7. Competent authorities shall provide providers and prospective providers participating in the AI regulatory sandbox with guidance on regulatory expectations and how to fulfill the requirements and obligations set out in this Regulation.\n\n   Upon request of the provider or prospective provider of the AI system, the competent authority shall provide a written proof of the activities successfully carried out in the sandbox. The competent authority shall also provide an exit report detailing the activities carried out in the sandbox and related results and learning outcomes. Providers may use such documentation to demonstrate their compliance with this Regulation through the conformity assessment process or relevant market surveillance activities. In this regard, the exit reports and written proofs provided by the national competent authority shall be taken positively into account by market surveillance authorities and notified bodies, with a view to accelerating conformity assessment procedures to a reasonable extent.\n\n8. Subject to the confidentiality provisions in [Article 78](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-78), and with the agreement of the provider or prospective provider, the Commission and Board shall be authorized to access exit reports and take them into account as appropriate when exercising their tasks under this Regulation. If both parties agree, these reports might be made publicly available through a single information platform referred to in this Article.\n\n9. The establishment of AI regulatory sandboxes aims to contribute to several objectives:\n\n   - Improving legal certainty to achieve regulatory compliance with this Regulation or other applicable Union laws.\n   - Supporting collaboration among different entities involved in setting up an AI Regulatory Sandbox.\n   - Fostering innovation within an AI ecosystem.\n   - Providing evidence-based insights.\n   - Facilitating access to markets for innovative artificial intelligence systems (AI) by SMEs including startups.\n\n10\\. National competent authorities should ensure that any innovative AI systems involving personal data processing or falling under another country's supervisory jurisdiction are coordinated appropriately with relevant national data protection authorities or other relevant national or international organizations involved in data handling.\n\n11\\. The AI Regulatory Sandboxes should not affect supervisory powers exercised by competent authorities over these sandboxes beyond what is necessary for ensuring compliance with regulations governing these areas.\n\n12\\. Providers participating in these sandboxes should still bear responsibility for damages caused by experimenting within them according to applicable Union laws on liability.\n\n13\\. The design of these sandboxes should enable cross-border cooperation between competent authorities.\n\n14\\. National competent authorities should coordinate efforts within their frameworks while cooperating with each other via board mechanisms.\n\n15\\. National competent authorities should notify about new establishments annually until termination dates are specified by law.\n\n### Relevant Recitals\n\n- [Recital 138](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-138)\n- [Recital 139](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-139)\n- [Recital 140](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-140)\n- [Recital 142](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-142)\n- [Recital 143](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-143)\n- [Recital 144](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recialtio-nal%20-%C3%A0%C2%A0%E2%80%9C%E2%80%9CAI%20Act%20Service%20Desk%E2%80%9D)\n\nView:\n[Official Text](https://eur-legis.speeches.consilium.ee/rulemaking/document.html?docid=ECLI_6_2024_689_ENG)\n\n---\n\n**AI Act Service Desk**\n\nThis site is managed by:\nDirectorate-General for Communications Networks Content & Technology\n\n* [Accessibility](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/accessibility-statement)\n\n**Contact Us**\n* Contact: [Contact Us](mailto:CNECT-AIOFFICE@ec.europa.eu)\n\n**About Us**\n* Copyright Notice\n* Legal Notice\n* Privacy Statement\n* About Directorate-General CONNECT\n```\n\n(Note: The links provided are placeholders since actual URLs cannot be directly linked from Markdown.)\n```", "fetched_at_utc": "2025-12-28T21:42:59Z", "sha256": "ac318cc4d16bb2d8a3cd2ff31a35e7c30a9148b265a5a5f62f95a28c0ddeaca8", "meta": {"jina_status": 20000, "jina_code": 200, "description": null, "links": null, "images": null, "usage": {"tokens": 12000}}}

Certain Member States have already explored the adoption of national rules to ensure that AI is trustworthy and safe and is developed and used in accordance with fundamental rights obligations. Diverging national rules may lead to the fragmentation of the internal market and may decrease legal certainty for operators that develop, import or use AI systems. A consistent and high level of protection throughout the Union should therefore be ensured in order to achieve trustworthy AI, while divergences hampering the free circulation, innovation, deployment and the uptake of AI systems and related products and services within the internal market should be prevented by laying down uniform obligations for operators and guaranteeing the uniform protection of overriding reasons of public interest and of rights of persons throughout the internal market on the basis of [Article 114](/en/ai-act/article-114) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). To the extent that this Regulation contains specific rules on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data concerning restrictions of the use of AI systems for remote biometric identification for the purpose of law enforcement, of the use of AI systems for risk assessments of natural persons for the purpose of law enforcement and of the use of AI systems of biometric categorisation for the purpose of law enforcement, it is appropriate to base this Regulation, in so far as those specific rules are concerned, on [Article 16](/en/ai-act/article-16) TFEU.

The harmonised rules laid down in this Regulation should apply across sectors and, in line with the New Legislative Framework, should be without prejudice to existing Union law, in particular on data protection, consumer protection, fundamental rights, employment, and protection of workers, and product safety, to which this Regulation is complementary. As a consequence, all rights and remedies provided for by such Union law to consumers, and other persons on whom AI systems may have a negative impact, including as regards the compensation of possible damages pursuant to Council Directive 85/374/EEC[(10)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:1985:210:TOC) remain unaffected and fully applicable. Furthermore, in the context of employment and protection of workers, this Regulation should therefore not affect Union law on social policy and national labour law, in compliance with Union law, concerning employment and working conditions, including health and safety at work and the relationship between employers and workers. This Regulation should also not affect the exercise of fundamental rights as recognised in the Member States and at Union level, including the right or freedom to strike or to take other action covered by the specific industrial relations systems in Member States as well as the right to negotiate, to conclude and enforce collective agreements or to take collective action in accordance with national law. This Regulation should not affect the provisions aiming to improve working conditions in platform work laid down in a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on improving working conditions in platform work. Moreover, this Regulation aims to strengthen the effectiveness of such existing rights and remedies by establishing specific requirements and obligations, including in respect of the transparency, technical documentation and record-keeping of AI systems. Furthermore, the obligations placed on various operators involved in the AI value chain under this Regulation should apply without prejudice to national law, in compliance with Union law, having the effect of limiting the use of certain AI systems where such law falls outside the scope of this Regulation or pursues legitimate public interest objectives other than those pursued by this Regulation. For example, national labour law and law on the protection of minors, namely persons below the age of 18, taking into account the UNCRC General Comment No 25 (2021) on children’s rights in relation to the digital environment, insofar as they are not specific to AI systems and pursue other legitimate public interest objectives, should not be affected by this Regulation.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 2: Scope](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-2)\n*   [Article 29: Application of a conformity assessment body for notification](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-29)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).

Moreover, the definition should be based on key characteristics of AI systems that distinguish it from simpler traditional software systems or programming approaches and should not cover systems that are based on the rules defined solely by natural persons to automatically execute operations. A key characteristic of AI systems is their capability to infer. This capability to infer refers to the process of obtaining the outputs, such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions, which can influence physical and virtual environments, and to a capability of AI systems to derive models or algorithms, or both, from inputs or data. The techniques that enable inference while building an AI system include machine learning approaches that learn from data how to achieve certain objectives, and logic- and knowledge-based approaches that infer from encoded knowledge or symbolic representation of the task to be solved. The capacity of an AI system to infer transcends basic data processing by enabling learning, reasoning or modelling. The term ‘machine-based’ refers to the fact that AI systems run on machines. The reference to explicit or implicit objectives underscores that AI systems can operate according to explicit defined objectives or to implicit objectives. The objectives of the AI system may be different from the intended purpose of the AI system in a specific context. For the purposes of this Regulation, environments should be understood to be the contexts in which the AI systems operate, whereas outputs generated by the AI system reflect different functions performed by AI systems and include predictions, content, recommendations or decisions. AI systems are designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy, meaning that they have some degree of independence of actions from human involvement and of capabilities to operate without human intervention. The adaptiveness that an AI system could exhibit after deployment refers to self-learning capabilities, allowing the system to change while in use. AI systems can be used on a standalone basis or as a component of a product, irrespective of whether the system is physically integrated into the product (embedded) or serves the functionality of the product without being integrated therein (non-embedded).\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 3: Definitions](/en/ai-act/article-3)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).

In the case of ‘real-time’ systems, the capturing of the biometric data, the comparison and the identification occur all instantly, near-instantaneously or in any event without a significant delay. In this regard, there should be no scope for circumventing the rules of this Regulation on the ‘real-time’ use of the AI systems concerned by providing for minor delays. ‘Real-time’ systems involve the use of ‘live’ or ‘near-live’ material, such as video footage, generated by a camera or other device with similar functionality. In the case of ‘post’ systems, in contrast, the biometric data has already been captured and the comparison and identification occur only after a significant delay. This involves material, such as pictures or video footage generated by closed circuit television cameras or private devices, which has been generated before the use of the system in respect of the natural persons concerned.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 3: Definitions](/en/ai-act/article-3)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).

This is the case, for example, where an operator established in the Union contracts certain services to an operator established in a third country in relation to an activity to be performed by an AI system that would qualify as high-risk. In those circumstances, the AI system used in a third country by the operator could process data lawfully collected in and transferred from the Union, and provide to the contracting operator in the Union the output of that AI system resulting from that processing, without that AI system being placed on the market, put into service or used in the Union. To prevent the circumvention of this Regulation and to ensure an effective protection of natural persons located in the Union, this Regulation should also apply to providers and deployers of AI systems that are established in a third country, to the extent the output produced by those systems is intended to be used in the Union. Nonetheless, to take into account existing arrangements and special needs for future cooperation with foreign partners with whom information and evidence is exchanged, this Regulation should not apply to public authorities of a third country and international organisations when acting in the framework of cooperation or international agreements concluded at Union or national level for law enforcement and judicial cooperation with the Union or the Member States, provided that the relevant third country or international organisation provides adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals. Where relevant, this may cover activities of entities entrusted by the third countries to carry out specific tasks in support of such law enforcement and judicial cooperation. Such framework for cooperation or agreements have been established bilaterally between Member States and third countries or between the European Union, Europol and other Union agencies and third countries and international organisations. The authorities competent for supervision of the law enforcement and judicial authorities under this Regulation should assess whether those frameworks for cooperation or international agreements include adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals. Recipient national authorities and Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies making use of such outputs in the Union remain accountable to ensure their use complies with Union law. When those international agreements are revised or new ones are concluded in the future, the contracting parties should make utmost efforts to align those agreements with the requirements of this Regulation.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 2: Scope](/en/ai-act/article-2)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).

It is therefore necessary to prohibit certain unacceptable AI practices, to lay down requirements for high-risk AI systems and obligations for the relevant operators, and to lay down transparency obligations for certain AI systems.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 3: Definitions](/en/ai-act/article-3)\n*   [Article 5: Prohibited AI practices](/en/ai-act/article-5)\n\n---\n\n## Chapter I: General Provisions\n\n*   [Article 1: Subject matter](/en/ai-act/article-1)\n*   [Article 2: Scope](/en/ai-act/article-2)\n*   [Article 3: Definitions](/en/ai-act/article-3)\n*   [Article 4: AI literacy](/en/ai-act/article-4)\n\n## Chapter II: Prohibited AI Practices\n\n*   [Article 5: Prohibited AI practices](/en/ai-act/article-5)\n\n## Chapter III: High-Risk AI Systems\n\n### Section 1: Classification of AI Systems as High-Risk\n\n*   [Article 6: Classification rules for high-risk AI systems](/en/ai-act/article-6)\n*   [Article 7: Amendments to Annex III](/en/ai-act/article-7)\n\n### Section 2: Requirements for High-Risk AI Systems\n\n*   [Article 8: Compliance with the requirements](/en/ai-act/article-8)\n*   [Article 9: Risk management system](/en/ai-act/article-9)\n*   [Article 10: Data and data governance](/en/ai-act/article-10)\n*   [Article 11: Technical documentation](/en/ai-act/article-11)\n*   [Article 12: Record-keeping](/en/ai-act/article-12)\n*   [Article 13: Transparency and provision of information to deployers](/en/ai-act/article-13)\n*   [Article 14: Human oversight](/en/ai-act/article-14)\n*   [Article 15: Accuracy, robustness and cybersecurity](/en/ai-act/article-15)\n\n### Section 3: Obligations of Providers and Deployers of High-Risk AI Systems and Other Parties\n\n*   [Article 16: Obligations of providers of high-risk AI systems](/en/ai-act/article-16)\n*   [Article 17: Quality management system](/en/ai-act/article-17)\n*   [Article 18: Documentation keeping](/en/ai-act/article-18)\n*   [Article 19: Automatically generated logs](/en/ai-act/article-19)\n*   [Article 20: Corrective actions and duty of information]( Article )[](/en/)\n    *   \n    *   \n\n**Subsections**\n\n#### Subsection A:\n\n##### Articles:\n\n[...]\n\n#### Subsection B:\n\n##### Articles:\n\n[...]\n\n## Chapter IV: Transparency Obligations for Providers and Deployers of Certain AI Systems\n\n*   [Article 50: Transparency obligations for providers and deployers of certain AI systems](/en/ai-\n\n## Chapter V: General-Purpose AI Models\n\n### Section 1: Classification Rules\n\n[...]\n\n### Section 2:\n#### Articles:\n\n[...]\n\n### Section 3:\n#### Articles:\n\n[...]\n\n### Section 4:\n#### Articles:\n\n[...]\n\n## Chapter VI: Measures in Support of Innovation\n\n*   [Article 57: AI regulatory sandboxes](https://www.ai.act.service.desk.ec.europa.eu/en/#article_57 \"Link\")\n*   [Article 58 Detailed arrangements for, and functioning of, AI regulatory sandboxes https://www.ai.act.service.desk.ec.europa.eu/en/#article_58 \"Link\"]\n*   **Subsections**\n    #### Sections A & B:\n    ##### Articles:\n    [...]\n    #### Sections C & D:\n    ##### Articles:\n    [...]\n    #### Section E:\n    ##### Articles:\n    [...]\n    #### Section F:\n    ##### Articles:\n    [...]\n    #### Section G:\n    ##### Articles:\n    [...]\n\n## Chapter VII: Governance\n\n### Section A\n#### Articles:\n\n[...]\n\n### Section B\n#### Articles:\n\n[...]\n\n## Chapter VIII： EU Database for High-Risk AI Systems\n\n[...]\n\n## Chapter IX： Post-Market Monitoring, Information Sharing and Market Surveillance\n\n### Section A\n#### Articles:\n\n[...]\n\n### Section B\n#### Articles:\n\n[...]\n\n### Section C\n#### Articles:\n\n[...]\n\n### Section D\n#### Articles:\n\n[...]\n\n### Section E\n#### Articles:\n\n[...]\n\n**Subsections**\n\n##### Sections A & B:\n###### Articles:\n...\n\n##### Sections C & D:\n###### Articles:\n...\n\n##### Sections E & F:\n###### Articles:\n...\n\n##### Sections G & H：\n###### Articles:\n...\n\n**Subsections**\n\n##### Sections I & J :\n###### Articles:\n\n\n```", "fetched_at_utc": "2025-12-29T08:53:41Z", "sha256": "2abe991d99d66ef29e699f3b7f030676d6cdc392bdc4c60c5e9487fe010a30b5", "meta": {"jina_status": 20000, "jina_code": 200, "description": null, "links": null, "images": null, "usage": {"tokens": 12000}}}

In those guidelines, the AI HLEG developed seven non-binding ethical principles for AI which are intended to help ensure that AI is trustworthy and ethically sound. The seven principles include human agency and oversight; technical robustness and safety; privacy and data governance; transparency; diversity, non-discrimination and fairness; societal and environmental well-being and accountability. Without prejudice to the legally binding requirements of this Regulation and any other applicable Union law, those guidelines contribute to the design of coherent, trustworthy and human-centric AI, in line with the Charter and with the values on which the Union is founded. According to the guidelines of the AI HLEG, human agency and oversight means that AI systems are developed and used as a tool that serves people, respects human dignity and personal autonomy, and that is functioning in a way that can be appropriately controlled and overseen by humans. Technical robustness and safety means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that allows robustness in the case of problems and resilience against attempts to alter the use or performance of the AI system so as to allow unlawful use by third parties, and minimise unintended harm. Privacy and data governance means that AI systems are developed and used in accordance with privacy and data protection rules, while processing data that meets high standards in terms of quality and integrity. Transparency means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that allows appropriate traceability and explainability, while making humans aware that they communicate or interact with an AI system, as well as duly informing deployers of the capabilities and limitations of that AI system and affected persons about their rights. Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that includes diverse actors and promotes equal access, gender equality和文化多样性，同时避免歧视性影响和不公平偏见等禁止的法律行为。社会和环境福祉意味着AI系统在可持续且环保的基础上，并且有利于所有人类个体、社会以及民主，同时监测评估长期对个人、社会及民主的影响。\n\nThe application of these principles should be translated where possible into designing, using, developing, training or operating artificial intelligence models. These principles should also serve as a basis for drafting voluntary best practices under this Regulation.\n\n### This Recital relates to:\n\n*   [Article 13: Transparency](/en/ai-act/article-13)\n*   [Article 14: Human Oversight](/en/ai-act/article-14)\n*   [Article 15: Accuracy Robustness Cybersecurity](/en/ai-act/article-15)\n\n---\n\n## Recital Text\n\nWhile the risk-based approach is the basis for a proportionate and effective set of binding rules, it is important to recall the 2019 Ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI developed by the independent AI HLEG appointed by the Commission.

The placing on the market, the putting into service, or the use of certain AI systems with the objective to or the effect of materially distorting human behavior, whereby significant harms, in particular having sufficiently important adverse impacts on physical, psychological health, or financial interests are likely to occur, are particularly dangerous and should therefore be prohibited. Such AI systems deploy subliminal components such as audio, image, video stimuli that persons cannot perceive, as those stimuli are beyond human perception, or other manipulative or deceptive techniques that subvert or impair one's autonomy, decision-making, or free choice in ways that people are not consciously aware of those techniques or, where they are aware of them, can still be deceived or are not able to control or resist them. This could be facilitated, for example, by machine-brain interfaces or virtual reality as they allow for a higher degree of control of what stimuli are presented to persons, insofar as they may materially distort their behavior in a significantly harmful manner. In addition, AI systems may also otherwise exploit the vulnerabilities of a person or a specific group of persons due to their age, disability within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2019/882 of the European Parliament and of the Council, or a specific social or economic situation that is likely to make those persons more vulnerable to exploitation such as persons living in extreme poverty, ethnic or religious minorities. Such AI systems can be placed on the market, put into service, or used with the objective to or the effect of materially distorting the behavior of a person and in a manner that causes or is reasonably likely to cause significant harm to that or another person(s), including harms that may accumulate over time and should therefore be prohibited. It may not be possible to assume that there is an intention to distort behavior where the distortion results from factors external to the AI system which are outside the control of the provider or the deployer, namely factors that may not be reasonably foreseeable and therefore not possible for the provider or the deployer of the AI system to mitigate. In any case, it is not necessary for the provider or the deployer to have the intention to cause significant harm if such harm results from manipulative or exploitative AI-enabled practices. The prohibitions for such AI practices are complementary to the provisions contained in Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 5: Prohibited AI practices](/en/ai-act/article-5)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).

Those situations involve the search for certain victims of crime including missing persons; certain threats to the life or to the physical safety of natural persons or of a terrorist attack; and the localisation or identification of perpetrators or suspects of the criminal offences listed in an annex to this Regulation, where those criminal offences are punishable in the Member State concerned by a custodial sentence or a detention order for a maximum period of at least four years and as they are defined in the law of that Member State. Such a threshold for the custodial sentence or detention order in accordance with national law contributes to ensuring that the offence should be serious enough to potentially justify the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems. Moreover, the list of criminal offences provided in an annex to this Regulation is based on the 32 criminal offences listed in the Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA, taking into account that some of those offences are, in practice, likely to be more relevant than others, in that the recourse to ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification could, foreseeably, be necessary and proportionate to highly varying degrees for the practical pursuit of the localisation or identification of a perpetrator or suspect of the different criminal offences listed and having regard to the likely differences in the seriousness, probability and scale of the harm or possible negative consequences. An imminent threat to life or the physical safety of natural persons could also result from a serious disruption of critical infrastructure, as defined in [Article 2](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-2), point (4) of Directive (EU) 2022/2557 of the European Parliament and of the Council, where the disruption or destruction of such critical infrastructure would result in an imminent threat to life or the physical safety of a person, including through serious harm to the provision of basic supplies to the population or to the exercise of the core function of the State. In addition, this Regulation should preserve the ability for law enforcement, border control, immigration or asylum authorities to carry out identity checks in the presence of the person concerned in accordance with the conditions set out in Union and national law for such checks. In particular, law enforcement, border control, immigration or asylum authorities should be able to use information systems, in accordance with Union or national law, to identify persons who, during an identity check, either refuse to be identified or are unable to state or prove their identity, without being required by this Regulation to obtain prior authorisation. This could be, for example, a person involved in a crime, being unwilling, or unable due to an accident or a medical condition, to disclose their identity to law enforcement authorities.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 5: Prohibited AI practices](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-5)\n```", "fetched_at_utc": "2025-12-29T08:56:38Z", "sha256": "de0eceeaf18321dc6ea440ea7bb91d88c8b8f2d62816d1b217b28d5bc98504e9", "meta": {"jina_status": 20000, "jina_code": 200, "description": null, "links": null, "images": null, "usage": {"tokens": 12000}}}

Such authorization should, in principle, be obtained prior to the use of the AI system with a view to identifying a person or persons. Exceptions to that rule should be allowed in duly justified situations on grounds of urgency, namely in situations where the need to use the systems concerned is such as to make it effectively and objectively impossible to obtain an authorization before commencing the use of the AI system. In such situations of urgency, the use of the AI system should be restricted to the absolute minimum necessary and should be subject to appropriate safeguards and conditions, as determined in national law and specified in the context of each individual urgent use case by the law enforcement authority itself. In addition, the law enforcement authority should in such situations request such authorization while providing the reasons for not having been able to request it earlier, without undue delay and at the latest within 24 hours. If such an authorization is rejected, the use of real-time biometric identification systems linked to that authorization should cease with immediate effect and all the data related to such use should be discarded and deleted. Such data includes input data directly acquired by an AI system in the course of the use of such system as well as the results and outputs of the use linked to that authorization. It should not include input that is legally acquired in accordance with another Union or national law.

Therefore, such use and processing should be possible only in as far as it is compatible with the framework set by this Regulation, without there being scope, outside that framework, for the competent authorities, where they act for purpose of law enforcement, to use such systems and process such data in connection thereto on the grounds listed in [Article 10](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-10) of Directive (EU) 2016/680. In that context, this Regulation is not intended to provide the legal basis for the processing of personal data under [Article 8](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-8) of Directive (EU) 2016/680. However, the use of real-time remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for purposes other than law enforcement, including by competent authorities, should not be covered by the specific framework regarding such use for the purpose of law enforcement set by this Regulation. Such use for purposes other than law enforcement should therefore not be subject to the requirement of an authorisation under this Regulation and the applicable detailed rules of national law that may give effect to that authorisation.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 5: Prohibited AI practices](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-5)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).

Among the key shortcomings of such systems are the limited reliability, the lack of specificity and the limited generalisability. Therefore, AI systems identifying or inferring emotions or intentions of natural persons on the basis of their biometric data may lead to discriminatory outcomes and can be intrusive to the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons. Considering the imbalance of power in the context of work or education, combined with the intrusive nature of these systems, such systems could lead to detrimental or unfavourable treatment of certain natural persons or whole groups thereof. Therefore, the placing on the market, the putting into service, or the use of AI systems intended to be used to detect the emotional state of individuals in situations related to the workplace and education should be prohibited. That prohibition should not cover AI systems placed on the market strictly for medical or safety reasons, such as systems intended for therapeutical use.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 5: Prohibited AI practices](/en/ai-act/article-5)\n\n---\n\n## Contact Us\n\n*   [Contact the AI Office](mailto:CNECT-AIOFFICE@ec.europa.eu)\n```\n\n(Note: The refined markdown focuses solely on extracting relevant content from the provided HTML document according to your instructions.)\n```", "fetched_at_utc": "2025-12-29T08:59:50Z", "sha256": "9c1ff28d04f29e35f7041451f831437c1dae64ad6bdad0ab34e2f8e97ee07ba5", "meta": {"jina_status": 20000, "jina_code": 200, "description": null, "links": null, "images": null, "usage": {"tokens": 12000}}}

Those requirements should ensure that high-risk AI systems available in the Union or whose output is otherwise used in the Union do not pose unacceptable risks to important Union public interests as recognized and protected by Union law. On the basis of the New Legislative Framework, as clarified in the Commission notice ‘The “Blue Guide” on the implementation of EU product rules 2022’(20), the general rule is that more than one legal act of Union harmonization legislation, such as Regulations (EU) 2017/745(21) and (EU) 2017/746(22) of the European Parliament and of the Council or Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(23), may be applicable to one product, since the making available or putting into service can take place only when the product complies with all applicable Union harmonization legislation. To ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary administrative burdens or costs, providers of a product that contains one or more high-risk AI systems, to which the requirements of this Regulation and of the Union harmonization legislation listed in an annex to this Regulation apply, should have flexibility with regard to operational decisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains one or more AI systems with all applicable requirements of the Union harmonization legislation in an optimal manner. AI systems identified as high-risk should be limited to those that have a significant harmful impact on the health, safety and fundamental rights of persons in the Union and such limitation should minimize any potential restriction to international trade.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 6: Classification rules for high-risk AI systems](/en/ai-act/article-6)\n*   [Article 8: Compliance with the requirements](/en/ai-act/article-8)\n\n---\n\n## Contact Us\n\n*   [Contact us](mailto:CNECT-AIOFFICE@ec.europa.eu)\n\n## About Us\n\n*   [Copyright notice](/en/copyright-notice)\n*   [Legal notice](/en/legal-notice)\n*   [Privacy statement](/en/privacy-statement-ai-act-service-desk-website)\n*   [About Directorate-General CONNECT](https://commission.europa.eu/about-departments-and-executive-agencies/communications-networks-content-and-technology_en)\n\n[![European Commission Logo](https://webtools.europa.eu/images/logos/logo.png)](https://commission.europa.eu/index_en)\n\n## Social Media Links\n\n*   [Contact Director-General Connect via email](mailto:CNECT-AIOFFICE@ec.europa.eu)\n*   Follow Director-General Connect on social media:\n    *   [](https://twitter.com/connect_eu)\n    *   [](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/directorate-general-connect/)\n    *   [](https://www.youtube.com/@connect_eu/videos)\n    *   [](https://www.instagram.com/connect_eu/)\n    *   [](https://www.facebook.com/DirectorateGeneralConnect/)\n    *   [](https://www.flickr.com/photos/connect_eu/)\n    *   [](https://www.tiktok.com/@directorategeneralconnect?lang=en)\n\n## Legal Information\n\n*   [Accessiblity Statement](/en/accessibility-statement)\n*   [Cookie Policy](https://commission.europa.eu/cookies_en)\n*   [Privacy Policy](https://commission.europa.eu/privacy-policy_en)\n*   [Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://commission.europa.eu/legal-notice/vulnerability-disclosure-policy_en)\n\n[![European Commission Logo](https://webtools.europa.eu/images/logos/logo.png)](https://commission.europa.eu/index_en)\n\n## Footer Links\n\n### Contact Us\n\n*   Email: [CNECT-AIOFFICE@ec.europa.eu](mailto:CNECT-AIOFFICE@ec.europa.eu)\n\n### About Us\n\n*   Copyright Notice\n*   Legal Notice\n*   Privacy Statement\n*   About Directorate-General CONNECT\n\n### Additional Links\n\n#### Social Media Links\n\n*   Email: [CNECT-AIOFFICE@ec.europa.eu](mailto:CNECT-AIOFFICE@ec.europa.edu)\n*   Follow Director-General Connect on social media:\n    *   [](https://twitter.com/connect_eu)\n    *   [](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/directorate-general-connect/)\n    *   [](https://www.youtube.com/@connect_eu/videos)\n    *   [](https://www.instagram.com/connect_eu/)\n    *   [](https://www.facebook.com/DirectorateGeneralConnect/)\n    *   [](https://www.flickr.com/photos/connect_eu/)\n    *   [](https://www.tiktok.com/@directorategeneralconnect?lang=en)\n\n#### Legal Information\n\n*   Accessibility Statement\n*   Cookie Policy\n*   Privacy Policy\n```", "fetched_at_utc": "2025-12-29T09:00:35Z", "sha256": "9ecf6e2cdf47f5a9d534c0da0f4bfcbf3f58a1ea73ad2d2fb777b97ca1f8d412", "meta": {"jina_status": 20000, "jina_code": 200, "description": null, "links": null, "images": null, "usage": {"tokens": 12000}}}

Consistent with the objectives of Union harmonisation legislation to facilitate the free movement of products in the internal market and to ensure that only safe and otherwise compliant products find their way into the market, it is important that the safety risks that may be generated by a product as a whole due to its digital components, including AI systems, are duly prevented and mitigated. For instance, increasingly autonomous robots, whether in the context of manufacturing or personal assistance and care should be able to safely operate and perform their functions in complex environments. Similarly, in the health sector where the stakes for life and health are particularly high, increasingly sophisticated diagnostics systems and systems supporting human decisions should be reliable and accurate.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 6: Classification rules for high-risk AI systems](/en/ai-act/article-6)\n\n---\n\n## Contact Us\n\n*   [Contact the AI Office](mailto:CNECT-AIOFFICE@ec.europa.eu)\n```\n\n(Note: The refined markdown focuses strictly on the core content provided within the `<main>` tag while excluding navigation elements like headers, footers, sidebars, etc.)\n```", "fetched_at_utc": "2025-12-29T09:00:47Z", "sha256": "a9afabbd0a8d6894ac931b4dd0ca4da912498dd5a864a1fef60c64fd6e5071c4", "meta": {"jina_status": 20000, "jina_code": 200, "description": null, "links": null, "images": null, "usage": {"tokens": 12000}}}

Those rights include the right to human dignity, respect for private and family life, protection of personal data, freedom of expression and information, freedom of assembly and of association, the right to non-discrimination, the right to education, consumer protection, workers’ rights, the rights of persons with disabilities, gender equality, intellectual property rights, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, the right of defence and the presumption of innocence, and the right to good administration. In addition to those rights, it is important to highlight the fact that children have specific rights as enshrined in [Article 24](/en/ai-act/article-24) of the Charter and in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, further developed in the UNCRC General Comment No 25 as regards the digital environment, both of which require consideration of the children’s vulnerabilities and provision of such protection and care as necessary for their well-being. The fundamental right to a high level of environmental protection enshrined in the Charter and implemented in Union policies should also be considered when assessing the severity of the harm that an AI system can cause, including in relation to the health and safety of persons.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 6: Classification rules for high-risk AI systems](/en/ai-act/article-6)\n*   [Article 8: Compliance with the requirements](/en/ai-act/article-8)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).

For the purposes of this Regulation, an AI system that does not materially influence the outcome of decision-making should be understood to be an AI system that does not have an impact on the substance, and thereby the outcome, of decision-making, whether human or automated. An AI system that does not materially influence the outcome of decision-making could include situations in which one or more of the following conditions are fulfilled. The first such condition should be that the AI system is intended to perform a narrow procedural task, such as an AI system that transforms unstructured data into structured data, an AI system that classifies incoming documents into categories or an AI system that is used to detect duplicates among a large number of applications. Those tasks are of such narrow and limited nature that they pose only limited risks which are not increased through the use of an AI system in a context that is listed as a high-risk use in an annex to this Regulation. The second condition should be that the task performed by the AI system is intended to improve the result of a previously completed human activity that may be relevant for the purposes of the high-risk uses listed in an annex to this Regulation. Considering those characteristics, the AI system provides only an additional layer to a human activity with consequently lowered risk. That condition would, for example, apply to AI systems that are intended to improve the language used in previously drafted documents, for example in relation to professional tone, academic style of language or by aligning text to a certain brand messaging. The third condition should be that the AI system is intended to detect decision-making patterns or deviations from prior decision-making patterns. The risk would be lowered because the use of the AI system follows a previously completed human assessment which it is not meant to replace or influence, without proper human review. Such AI systems include for instance those that, given a certain grading pattern of a teacher, can be used to check ex post whether the teacher may have deviated from the grading pattern so as to flag potential inconsistencies or anomalies. The fourth condition should be that the AI system is intended to perform a task that is only preparatory to an assessment relevant for the purposes of the AI systems listed in an annex to this Regulation, thus making the possible impact of the output of the system very low in terms of representing a risk for the assessment to follow. That condition covers, inter alia, smart solutions for file handling, which include various functions from indexing, searching, text and speech processing or linking data to other data sources, or AI systems used for translation of initial documents. In any case, AI systems used in high-risk use-cases listed in an annex to this Regulation should be considered to pose significant risks of harm to the health, safety or fundamental rights if the AI system implies profiling within the meaning of [Article 4](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-4), point (4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or [Article 3](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-3), point (4) of Directive (EU) 2016/680 or [Article 3](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-3), point (5) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. To ensure traceability and transparency, a provider who considers that an AI system is not high-risk on the basis of these conditions should draw up documentation regarding their assessment before placing them on market or putting them into service and provide this documentation upon request from national competent authorities. Such a provider should register their AI system in Europe's database established under this regulation.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 6: Classification rules for high-risk AI systems](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-6)\n*   [Article 7: Amendments to Annex III](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-7)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).

Natural persons applying for or receiving essential public assistance benefits and services from public authorities, such as healthcare services, social security benefits, social services providing protection in cases like maternity, illness, industrial accidents, dependency, or old age and loss of employment, are typically dependent on these benefits and services and face vulnerabilities related to the responsible authorities. If AI systems are used for determining whether such benefits and services should be granted, denied, reduced, revoked, or reclaimed by authorities, including whether beneficiaries are rightfully entitled to them, these systems may have a significant impact on individuals' livelihoods and could infringe their fundamental rights such as the right to social protection, non-discrimination, human dignity, or an effective remedy. This Regulation should not hinder the development and use of innovative approaches in the public administration unless they do not pose a high risk to legal and natural persons. Additionally, AI systems intended for evaluating credit scores or creditworthiness of natural persons should also be classified as high-risk AI systems due to potential discrimination against individuals or groups based on race, ethnicity, gender, disability status, age, or sexual orientation. These systems can perpetuate historical patterns of discrimination while creating new forms of discriminatory impacts. While some AI systems used for risk assessment and pricing in relation to natural persons for health and life insurance fall within this category but do not constitute high-risk under this Regulation due to their limited impact on individuals' lives and finances. Furthermore, AI systems aimed at evaluating and classifying emergency calls by natural persons or dispatching emergency first response services should also be classified as high-risk because they make critical decisions regarding the safety and welfare of individuals without adequate safeguards against bias or discrimination.\n\n### Related Article\n\n[Article 6: Classification rules for high-risk AI systems](/en/ai-act/article-6)\n\n---\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).

In particular, if the AI system is not trained with high-quality data, does not meet adequate requirements in terms of its performance, its accuracy or robustness, or is not properly designed and tested before being put on the market or otherwise put into service, it may single out people in a discriminatory or otherwise incorrect or unjust manner. Furthermore, the exercise of important procedural fundamental rights, such as the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial as well as the right of defence and the presumption of innocence, could be hampered, in particular, where such AI systems are not sufficiently transparent, explainable and documented.

AI systems specifically intended to be used for administrative proceedings by tax and customs authorities as well as by financial intelligence units carrying out administrative tasks analysing information pursuant to Union anti-money laundering law should not be classified as high-risk AI systems used by law enforcement authorities for the purpose of prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences. The use of AI tools by law enforcement and other relevant authorities should not become a factor of inequality, or exclusion. The impact of the use of AI tools on the defence rights of suspects should not be ignored, in particular the difficulty in obtaining meaningful information on the functioning of those systems and the resulting difficulty in challenging their results in court, in particular by natural persons under investigation.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 6: Classification rules for high-risk AI systems](/en/ai-act/article-6)\n*   [Article 13: Transparency and provision of information to deployers](/en/ai-act/article-13)\n\n---\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).

In particular, to address the risks of potential biases, errors and opacity, it is appropriate to qualify as high-risk AI systems intended to be used by a judicial authority or on its behalf to assist judicial authorities in researching and interpreting facts and the law and in applying the law to a concrete set of facts. AI systems intended to be used by alternative dispute resolution bodies for those purposes should also be considered to be high-risk when the outcomes of the alternative dispute resolution proceedings produce legal effects for the parties. The use of AI tools can support the decision-making power of judges or judicial independence, but should not replace it: the final decision-making must remain a human-driven activity. The classification of AI systems as high-risk should not, however, extend to AI systems intended for purely ancillary administrative activities that do not affect the actual administration of justice in individual cases, such as anonymization or pseudonymization of judicial decisions, documents or data, communication between personnel, administrative tasks.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 6: Classification rules for high-risk AI systems](/en/ai-act/article-6)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).

The measures adopted by the providers to comply with the mandatory requirements of this Regulation should take into account the generally acknowledged state of the art on AI, be proportionate and effective to meet the objectives of this Regulation. Based on the New Legislative Framework, as clarified in Commission notice ‘The “Blue Guide” on the implementation of EU product rules 2022’, the general rule is that more than one legal act of Union harmonisation legislation may be applicable to one product, since the making available or putting into service can take place only when the product complies with all applicable Union harmonisation legislation. The hazards of AI systems covered by the requirements of this Regulation concern different aspects than the existing Union harmonisation legislation and therefore the requirements of this Regulation would complement the existing body of the Union harmonisation legislation. For example, machinery or medical devices products incorporating an AI system might present risks not addressed by the essential health and safety requirements set out in the relevant Union harmonised legislation, as that sectoral law does not deal with risks specific to AI systems. This calls for a simultaneous and complementary application of the various legislative acts. To ensure consistency and to avoid an unnecessary administrative burden and unnecessary costs, providers of a product that contains one or more high-risk AI systems, to which the requirements of this Regulation and of the Union harmonisation legislation based on the New Legislative Framework and listed in an annex to this Regulation apply, should have flexibility with regard to operational decisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains one or more AI systems with all the applicable requirements of that Union harmonised legislation in an optimal manner. That flexibility could mean, for example a decision by the provider to integrate a part of the necessary testing and reporting processes, information and documentation required under this Regulation into already existing documentation and procedures required under existing Union harmonisation legislation based on the New Legislative Framework and listed in an annex to this Regulation. This should not, in any way, undermine the obligation of the provider to comply with all the applicable requirements.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 9: Risk management system](/en/ai-act/article-9)\n*   [Article 34: Operational obligations of notified bodies](/en/ai-act/article-34)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).

The risk-management system should be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure its continuing effectiveness, as well as justification and documentation of any significant decisions and actions taken subject to this Regulation.

The risk-management system should adopt the most appropriate risk-management measures in light of the state of the art in AI. When identifying the most appropriate risk-management measures, the provider should document and explain the choices made and, when relevant, involve experts and external stakeholders.

In order to enhance legibility and accessibility of the information included in the instructions of use, where appropriate, illustrative examples, for instance on the limitations and on the intended and precluded uses of the AI system, should be included. Providers should ensure that all documentation, including the instructions for use, contains meaningful, comprehensive, accessible and understandable information, taking into account the needs and foreseeable knowledge of target deployers.

To that end, appropriate human oversight measures should be identified by the provider of the system before its placement on the market or putting into service. In particular, where appropriate, such measures should guarantee that the system is subject to in-built operational constraints that cannot be overridden by the system itself and is responsive to the human operator, and that the natural persons to whom human oversight has been assigned have the necessary competence, training and authority to carry out that role. It is also essential, as appropriate, to ensure that high-risk AI systems include mechanisms to guide and inform a natural person to whom human oversight has been assigned to make informed decisions if, when and how to intervene in order to avoid negative consequences or risks or stop the system if it does not perform as intended. Considering the significant consequences for persons in the case of an incorrect match by certain biometric identification systems, it is appropriate to provide for an enhanced human oversight requirement for those systems so that no action or decision may be taken by the deployer on the basis of the identification resulting from the system unless this has been separately verified and confirmed by at least two natural persons. Those persons could be from one or more entities and include the person operating or using the system. This requirement should not pose unnecessary burden or delays, and it could be sufficient that the separate verifications by different persons are automatically recorded in the logs generated by the system. Given the specificities of the areas of law enforcement, migration, border control and asylum, this requirement should not apply where Union or national law considers the application of that requirement to be disproportionate.\n\n### Related Articles\n\n*   [Article 14: Human oversight](/en/ai-act/article-14)\n*   [Article 19: Automatically generated logs](/en/ai-act/article-19)\n\n---\n\n## Contact Us\n\n*   [Contact us](mailto:CNECT-AIOFFICE@ec.europa.eu)\n\n---\n\n## About Us\n\n*   [Copyright notice](/en/copyright-notice)\n*   [Legal notice](/en/legal-notice)\n*   [Privacy statement](/en/privacy-statement-ai-act-service-desk-website)\n*   [About Directorate-General CONNECT](https://commission.europa.eu/about-departments-and-executive-agencies/communications-networks-content-and-technology_en)\n\n---\n\n## Additional Links\n\n[Contact Europe's Commission](https://commission.europa.eu/contact-eu/social-media-channels_en#/search?page=0&institutions=european_commission)\n\n[Resources for partners](https://commission.europa.eu/resources-partners_en)\n\n[Report an IT vulnerability](https://commission.europa.eu/legal-notice/vulnerability-disclosure-policy_en)\n\n[Languages on our websites](https://commission.europa.eu/languages-our-websites_en)\n\n[Cookies](https://commission.europa.eu/cookies_en)\n\n[Privacy policy](https://commission.europa.eu/privacy-policy_en)\n\n[Legal notice](https://commission.europa.eu/legal-notice_en)\n```", "fetched_at_utc": "2025-12-29T09:10:46Z", "sha256": "f3551514995ffe62f8f2763e28dc38741a58de6a0814a9fee446ae1f1205bc48", "meta": {"jina_status": 20000, "jina_code": 200, "description": null, "links": null, "images": null, "usage": {"tokens": 12000}}}

Therefore, technical and organizational measures should be taken to ensure robustness of high-risk AI systems, for example by designing and developing appropriate technical solutions to prevent or minimize harmful or otherwise undesirable behavior. Those technical solutions may include, for instance, mechanisms enabling the system to safely interrupt its operation (fail-safe plans) in the presence of certain anomalies or when operation takes place outside certain predetermined boundaries.

Services important for individuals that are of public nature may also be provided by private entities. Private entities providing such public services are linked to tasks in the public interest such as in the areas of education, healthcare, social services, housing, administration of justice. The aim of the fundamental rights impact assessment is for the deployer to identify the specific risks to the rights of individuals or groups of individuals likely to be affected, identify measures to be taken in the case of a materialisation of those risks. The impact assessment should be performed prior to deploying the high-risk AI system, and should be updated when the deployer considers that any of the relevant factors have changed. The impact assessment should identify the deployer’s relevant processes in which the high-risk AI system will be used in line with its intended purpose, and should include a description of the period of time and frequency in which the system is intended to be used as well as of specific categories of natural persons and groups who are likely to be affected in the specific context of use. The assessment should also include the identification of specific risks of harm likely to have an impact on the fundamental rights of those persons or groups. While performing this assessment, the deployer should take into account information relevant to a proper assessment of the impact, including but not limited to the information given by the provider of the high-risk AI system in the instructions for use. In light of the risks identified, deployers should determine measures to be taken in the case of a materialisation of those risks, including for example governance arrangements in that specific context of use, such as arrangements for human oversight according to the instructions of use or, complaint handling and redress procedures, as they could be instrumental in mitigating risks to fundamental rights in concrete use-cases. After performing that impact assessment, the deployer should notify the relevant market surveillance authority. Where appropriate, to collect relevant information necessary to perform the impact assessment, deployers of high-risk AI systems, in particular when AI systems are used in the public sector, could involve relevant stakeholders, including the representatives of groups of persons likely to be affected by the AI system, independent experts, and civil society organisations in conducting such impact assessments and designing measures to be taken in the case of materialisation of the risks.

The definition should be based on the key functional characteristics of a general-purpose AI model, in particular the generality and the capability to competently perform a wide range of distinct tasks. These models are typically trained on large amounts of data, through various methods, such as self-supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement learning. General-purpose AI models may be placed on the market in various ways, including through libraries, application programming interfaces (APIs), as direct download, or as physical copy. These models may be further modified or fine-tuned into new models. Although AI models are essential components of AI systems, they do not constitute AI systems on their own. AI models require the addition of further components, such as for example a user interface, to become AI systems. AI models are typically integrated into and form part of AI systems. This Regulation provides specific rules for general-purpose AI models and for general-purpose AI models that pose systemic risks, which should apply also when these models are integrated or form part of an AI system. It should be understood that the obligations for the providers of general-purpose AI models should apply once the general-purpose AI models are placed on the market. When the provider of a general-purpose AI model integrates an own model into its own AI system that is made available on the market or put into service, that model should be considered to be placed on the market and, therefore, the obligations in this Regulation for models should continue to apply in addition to those for AI systems. The obligations laid down for models should in any case not apply when an own model is used for purely internal processes that are not essential for providing a product or a service to third parties and the rights of natural persons are not affected. Considering their potential significantly negative effects, the general-purpose AI models with systemic risk should always be subject to the relevant obligations under this Regulation. The definition should not cover AI models used before their placing on the market for the sole purpose of research, development and prototyping activities. This is without prejudice to the obligation to comply with this Regulation when, following such activities, a model is placed on the market.\n\n## This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 2: Scope](/en/ai-act/article-2)\n*   [Article 3: Definitions](/en/ai-act/article-3)\n*   [Article 53: Obligations for providers of general-purpose AI models](/en/ai-act/article-53)\n*   [Article 79: Procedure at national level for dealing with AI systems presenting a risk](/en/ai-act/article-79)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).

Since systemic risks result from particularly high capabilities, a general-purpose AI model should be considered to present systemic risks if it has high-impact capabilities, evaluated on the basis of appropriate technical tools and methodologies, or significant impact on the internal market due to its reach. High-impact capabilities in general-purpose AI models means capabilities that match or exceed the capabilities recorded in the most advanced general-purpose AI models. The full range of capabilities in a model could be better understood after its placing on the market or when deployers interact with the model. According to the state of the art at the time of entry into force of this Regulation, the cumulative amount of computation used for the training of the general-purpose AI model measured in floating point operations is one of the relevant approximations for model capabilities. The cumulative amount of computation used for training includes the computation used across the activities and methods that are intended to enhance the capabilities of the model prior to deployment, such as pre-training, synthetic data generation and fine-tuning. Therefore, an initial threshold of floating point operations should be set, which, if met by a general-purpose AI model, leads to a presumption that the model is a general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. This threshold should be adjusted over time to reflect technological and industrial changes, such as algorithmic improvements or increased hardware efficiency, and should be supplemented with benchmarks and indicators for model capability. To inform this, the AI Office should engage with the scientific community, industry, civil society and other experts. Thresholds, as well as tools and benchmarks for the assessment of high-impact capabilities, should be strong predictors of generality, its capabilities and associated systemic risk of general-purpose AI models, and could take into account the way the model will be placed on the market or the number of users it may affect. To complement this system, there should be a possibility for the Commission to take individual decisions designating a general-purpose AI model as a general-purpose AI model with systemic risk if it is found that such model has capabilities or an impact equivalent to those captured by the set threshold. That decision should be taken on the basis of an overall assessment of the criteria for the designation of a general-purpose AI model with systemic risk set out in an annex to this Regulation, such as quality or size of the training data set, number of business and end users, its input and output modalities, its level of autonomy and scalability, or the tools it has access to. Upon a reasoned request of a provider whose model has been designated as a general-purpose AI model with systemic risk, the Commission should take the request into account and may decide to reassess whether the general-purpose AI model can still be considered to present systemic risks.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 51: Classification of general-purpose AI models as general-purpose AI models with systemic risk](/en/ai-act/article-51)\n*   [Article 52: Procedure](/en/ai-act/article-52)\n\n---\n\n## Contact Us\n\n*   [Contact us](mailto:CNECT-AIOFFICE@ec.europa.eu)\n\n## About Us\n\n*   [Copyright notice](/en/copyright-notice)\n*   [Legal notice](/en/legal-notice)\n*   [Privacy statement](/en/privacy-statement-ai-act-service-desk-website)\n*   [About Directorate-General CONNECT](https://commission.europa.eu/about-departments-and-executive-agencies/communications-networks-content-and-technology_en)\n\n[![European Commission Logo](https://webtools.europa.eu/images/flags/eu.svg)](https://commission.europa.eu/index_en)\n\n## Legal Notice\n\n*   [Accessiblity Statement](/en/accessibility-statement)\n*   [Contact Europe's Commissioner](https://commission.europa.eu/about-european-commission/contact_en)\n*   [Social Media Channels](https://european-union.europa.eu/contact-eu/social-media-channels_en#/search?page=0&institutions=european_commission)\n*   [Resources for Partners](https://commission.europa.eu/resources-partners_en)\n*   [Report an IT Vulnerability](https://commission.europa.eu/resources-partners_en/report-an-it-vulnerability)\n\n## Language Options\n\n*   [Languages on Our Websites](https://commission.europa.eu/languages-our-websites_en)\n*   [Cookies Policy](https://commission.europa.eu/cookies_en)\n*   [Privacy Policy](https://commission.europa.eu/privacy-policy_en)\n*   [Legal Notice](https://commission.europa.eu/legal-notice_en)\n\n© European Union 2024\n```", "fetched_at_utc": "2025-12-29T09:23:28Z", "sha256": "d3f4266e4e3151516e8183068a8f66a05397089bbb41ed3dbdc4d7af200331c2", "meta": {"jina_status": 20000, "jina_code": 200, "description": null, "links": null, "images": null, "usage": {"tokens": 12000}}}

A general-purpose AI model that meets the applicable threshold for high-impact capabilities should be presumed to be a general-purpose AI models with systemic risk. The provider should notify the AI Office at the latest two weeks after the requirements are met or it becomes known that a general-purpose AI model will meet the requirements that lead to the presumption. This is especially relevant in relation to the threshold of floating point operations because training of general-purpose AI models takes considerable planning which includes the upfront allocation of compute resources and, therefore, providers of general-purpose AI models are able to know if their model would meet the threshold before the training is completed. In the context of that notification, the provider should be able to demonstrate that, because of its specific characteristics, a general-purpose AI model exceptionally does not present systemic risks, and that it thus should not be classified as a general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. That information is valuable for the AI Office to anticipate the placing on the market of general-purpose AI models with systemic risks and the providers can start to engage with the AI Office early on. That information is especially important with regard to general-purpose AI models that are planned to be released as open-source, given that, after the open-source model release, necessary measures to ensure compliance with the obligations under this Regulation may be more difficult to implement.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 52: Procedure](/en/ai-act/article-52)\n\n---\n\n## Contact Us\n\n*   [Contact the AI Office](mailto:CNECT-AIOFFICE@ec.europa.eu)\n\n## About Us\n\n*   [Copyright notice](/en/copyright-notice)\n*   [Legal notice](/en/legal-notice)\n*   [Privacy statement](/en/privacy-statement-ai-act-service-desk-website)\n*   [About Directorate-General CONNECT](https://commission.europa.eu/about-departments-and-executive-agencies/communications-networks-content-and-technology_en)\n\n[![European Commission Logo](https://webtools.europa.eu/images/flags/eu.svg)](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en \"European Commission\")\n\n[View official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).

Furthermore, providers should ensure an adequate level of cybersecurity protection for the model and its physical infrastructure, if appropriate, along the entire model lifecycle. Cybersecurity protection related to systemic risks associated with malicious use or attacks should duly consider accidental model leakage, unauthorized releases, circumvention of safety measures, and defense against cyberattacks, unauthorized access or model theft. That protection could be facilitated by securing model weights, algorithms, servers, and data sets, such as through operational security measures for information security, specific cybersecurity policies, adequate technical and established solutions, and cyber and physical access controls, appropriate to the relevant circumstances and the risks involved.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 10](/en/ai-act/article-10): Data and data governance\n*   [Article 15](/en/ai-act/article-15): Accuracy, robustness and cybersecurity\n*   [Article 55](/en/ai-act/article-55): Obligations of providers of general-purpose AI models with systemic risk\n\n---\n\n## Contact Us\n\n*   [Contact the AI Office](mailto:CNECT-AIOFFICE@ec.europa.eu)\n\n## About Us\n\n*   [Copyright notice](/en/copyright-notice)\n*   [Legal notice](/en/legal-notice)\n*   [Privacy statement](/en/privacy-statement-ai-act-service-desk-website)\n*   [About Directorate-General CONNECT](https://commission.europa.eu/about-departments-and-executive-agencies/communications-networks-content-and-technology_en)\n\n[![European Commission Logo](https://webtools.europa.eu/images/flags/eu.svg)](https://commission.europa.eu/index_en)\n\n## Legal Notice\n\n*   [Accessiblity Statement](/en/accessibility-statement)\n\n[![European Commission Logo](https://webtools.europa.eu/images/logos/logo.png)](https://commission.europa.eu/index_en)\n\n*   [Contact the European Commission](https://commission.europa.eu/about-european-commission/contact_en)\n*   [Follow the European Commission on social media](https://european-union.europa.eu/contact-eu/social-media-channels_en#/search?page=0&institutions=european_commission)\n*   [Resources for partners](https://commission.europa.eu/resources-partners_en)\n*   [Report an IT vulnerability](https://commission.europa.eu/legal-notice/vulnerability-disclosure-policy_en)\n\n*   [Languages on our websites](https://commission.europa.eu/languages-our-websites_en)\n*   [Cookies](https://commission.europa.eu/cookies_en)\n*   [Privacy policy](https://commission.europa.eu/privacy-policy_en)\n*   [Legal notice](https://commission.europa.eu/legal-notice_en)\n```", "fetched_at_utc": "2025-12-29T09:24:45Z", "sha256": "822bca707018994b99e12076b01be5990a84260f197f85367d1c4ba9ba015c02", "meta": {"jina_status": 20000, "jina_code": 200, "description": null, "links": null, "images": null, "usage": {"tokens": 12000}}}

To ensure that the codes of practice reflect the state of the art and duly take into account a diverse set of perspectives, the AI Office should collaborate with relevant national competent authorities, and could, where appropriate, consult with civil society organisations and other relevant stakeholders and experts, including the Scientific Panel, for the drawing up of such codes. Codes of practice should cover obligations for providers of general-purpose AI models and of general-purpose AI models presenting systemic risks.

Compliance with harmonised standards as defined in [Article 2](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-2), point (1)(c), of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council(41), which are normally expected to reflect the state of the art, should be a means for providers to demonstrate conformity with the requirements of this Regulation. A balanced representation of interests involving all relevant stakeholders in the development of standards, in particular SMEs, consumer organisations and environmental and social stakeholders in accordance with Articles 5 and 6 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 should therefore be encouraged. In order to facilitate compliance, the standardisation requests should be issued by the Commission without undue delay. When preparing the standardisation request, the Commission should consult the advisory forum and the Board in order to collect relevant expertise. However, in the absence of relevant references to harmonised standards, the Commission should be able to establish, via implementing acts, and after consultation of the advisory forum, common specifications for certain requirements under this Regulation. The common specification should be an exceptional fallback solution to facilitate the provider’s obligation to comply with the requirements of this Regulation, when the standardization request has not been accepted by any of the European standardization organizations, or when the relevant harmonized standards insufficiently address fundamental rights concerns, or when the harmonized standards do not comply with the request, or when there are delays in the adoption of an appropriate harmonized standard. Where such a delay in the adoption of a harmonized standard is due to technical complexity of that standard, this should be considered by the Commission before contemplating establishing common specifications.

Before using an AI system listed in the high-risk use cases in an annex to this Regulation, deployers of high-risk AI systems that are public authorities, agencies or bodies, should register themselves in such database and select the system that they envisage to use. Other deployers should be entitled to do so voluntarily. This section of the EU database should be publicly accessible, free of charge, the information should be easily navigable, understandable and machine-readable. The EU database should also be user-friendly, for example by providing search functionalities, including through keywords, allowing the general public to find relevant information to be submitted upon the registration of high-risk AI systems and on the use case of high-risk AI systems, set out in an annex to this Regulation, to which the high-risk AI systems correspond. Any substantial modification of high-risk AI systems should also be registered in the EU database. For high-risk AI systems in the area of law enforcement, migration, asylum and border control management, the registration obligations should be fulfilled in a secure non-public section of the EU database. Access to the secure non-public section should be strictly limited to the Commission as well as to market surveillance authorities with regard to their national section of that database. High-risk AI systems in the area of critical infrastructure should only be registered at national level. The Commission should be the controller of the EU database, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. In order to ensure the full functionality of the EU database, when deployed, the procedure for setting up the database should include developing functional specifications by the Commission and an independent audit report. The Commission should take into account cybersecurity risks when carrying out its tasks as data controller on the EU database.

In certain circumstances, the use of these systems should therefore be subject to specific transparency obligations without prejudice to the requirements and obligations for high-risk AI systems and subject to targeted exceptions to take into account the special need of law enforcement. In particular, natural persons should be notified that they are interacting with an AI system, unless this is obvious from the point of view of a natural person who is reasonably well-informed, observant and circumspect taking into account the circumstances and the context of use. When implementing that obligation, the characteristics of natural persons belonging to vulnerable groups due to their age or disability should be taken into account to the extent the AI system is intended to interact with those groups as well. Moreover, natural persons should be notified when they are exposed to AI systems that, by processing their biometric data, can identify or infer the emotions or intentions of those persons or assign them to specific categories. Such specific categories can relate to aspects such as sex, age, hair colour, eye colour, tattoos, personal traits, ethnic origin, personal preferences and interests.

The wide availability and increasing capabilities of those systems have a significant impact on the integrity and trust in the information ecosystem, raising new risks of misinformation and manipulation at scale, fraud, impersonation and consumer deception. In light of those impacts, the fast technological pace and the need for new methods and techniques to trace origin of information, it is appropriate to require providers of those systems to embed technical solutions that enable marking in a machine readable format and detection that the output has been generated or manipulated by an AI system and not a human. Such techniques and methods should be sufficiently reliable, interoperable, effective and robust as far as this is technically feasible, taking into account available techniques or a combination of such techniques, such as watermarks, metadata identifications, cryptographic methods for proving provenance and authenticity of content, logging methods, fingerprints or other techniques, as may be appropriate. When implementing this obligation, providers should also take into account the specificities and the limitations of the different types of content and the relevant technological and market developments in the field, as reflected in the generally acknowledged state of the art. Such techniques and methods can be implemented at the level of the AI system or at the level of the AI model, including general-purpose AI models generating content, thereby facilitating fulfilment of this obligation by the downstream provider of the AI system. To remain proportionate, it is appropriate to envisage that this marking obligation should not cover AI systems performing primarily an assistive function for standard editing or AI systems not substantially altering the input data provided by the deployer or the semantics thereof.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 50: Transparency obligations for providers and deployers of certain AI systems](/en/ai-act/article-50)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).

To ensure a legal framework that promotes innovation, is future-proof and resilient to disruption, Member States should ensure that their national competent authorities establish at least one AI regulatory sandbox at national level to facilitate the development and testing of innovative AI systems under strict regulatory oversight before these systems are placed on the market or otherwise put into service. Member States could also fulfil this obligation through participating in already existing regulatory sandboxes or establishing jointly a sandbox with one or more Member States’ competent authorities, insofar as this participation provides equivalent level of national coverage for the participating Member States. AI regulatory sandboxes could be established in physical, digital or hybrid form and may accommodate physical as well as digital products. Establishing authorities should also ensure that the AI regulatory sandboxes have the adequate resources for their functioning, including financial and human resources.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 57: AI regulatory sandboxes](/en/ai-act/article-57)\n*   [Article 58: Detailed arrangements for, and functioning of, AI regulatory sandboxes](/en/ai-act/article-58)\n*   [Article 59: Further processing of personal data for developing certain AI systems in the public interest in the AI regulatory sandbox](/en/ai-act/article-59)\n\n---\n\n## Contact Us\n\n*   [Contact the AI Office](mailto:CNECT-AIOFFICE@ec.europa.eu)\n\n---\n\n## About Us\n\n*   [Copyright notice](/en/copyright-notice)\n*   [Legal notice](/en/legal-notice)\n*   [Privacy statement](/en/privacy-statement-ai-act-service-desk-website)\n*   [About Directorate-General CONNECT](https://commission.europa.eu/about-departments-and-executive-agencies/communications-networks-content-and-technology_en)\n\n---\n\n## Additional Links\n\n[Contact the European Commission](https://commission.europa.eu/about-european-commission/contact_en)\n\n[Follow the European Commission on social media](https://european-union.europa.eu/contact-eu/social-media-channels_en#/search?page=0&institutions=european_commission)\n\n[Resources for partners](https://commission.europa.eu/resources-partners_en)\n\n[Report an IT vulnerability](https://commission.europa.eu/legal-notice/vulnerability-disclosure-policy_en)\n\n[Languages on our websites](https://commission.europa.eu/languages-our-websites_en)\n\n[Cookies](https://commission.europa.eu/cookies_en)\n\n[Privacy policy](https://commission.europa.eu/privacy-policy_en)\n\n[Legal notice](https://commission.europa.eu/legal-notice_en)\n```", "fetched_at_utc": "2025-12-29T09:32:37Z", "sha256": "49988d44f41cb817add587ae0d1d6ac0fac997b3cb9576019a7c98f7851fc09f", "meta": {"jina_status": 20000, "jina_code": 200, "description": null, "links": null, "images": null, "usage": {"tokens": 12000}}}

Moreover, the AI regulatory sandboxes should aim to enhance legal certainty for innovators and the competent authorities’ oversight and understanding of the opportunities, emerging risks, and the impacts of AI use, to facilitate regulatory learning for authorities and undertakings, including with a view to future adaptations of the legal framework, to support cooperation and the sharing of best practices with the authorities involved in the AI regulatory sandbox, and to accelerate access to markets, including by removing barriers for SMEs, including start-ups. AI regulatory sandboxes should be widely available throughout the Union, and particular attention should be given to their accessibility for SMEs, including start-ups. The participation in the AI regulatory sandbox should focus on issues that raise legal uncertainty for providers and prospective providers to innovate, experiment with AI in the Union, and contribute to evidence-based regulatory learning. The supervision of the AI systems in the AI regulatory sandbox should therefore cover their development, training, testing, and validation before they are placed on the market or put into service, as well as the notion and occurrence of substantial modifications that may require a new conformity assessment procedure. Any significant risks identified during the development and testing of such AI systems should result in adequate mitigation and, failing that, in the suspension of the development and testing process. Where appropriate, national competent authorities establishing AI regulatory sandboxes should cooperate with other relevant authorities, including those supervising the protection of fundamental rights, and could allow for the involvement of other actors within the AI ecosystem such as national or European standardisation organizations, notified bodies, testing and experimentation facilities, research and experimentation labs, European Digital Innovation Hubs, and relevant stakeholder and civil society organizations. To ensure uniform implementation across the Union and economies of scale, it is appropriate to establish common rules for the AI regulatory sandboxes’ implementation and a framework for cooperation between these relevant authorities involved in the supervision of the sandboxes. AI regulatory sandboxes established under this Regulation should be without prejudice to other laws allowing for the establishment of other sandboxes aimed at ensuring compliance with law other than this Regulation. Where appropriate, relevant competent authorities in charge of those other regulatory sandboxes should consider the benefits of using those sandboxes also for purposes of ensuring compliance with this Regulation. Upon agreement between national competent authorities and participants in the AI regulatory sandbox:\n- Testing in real-world conditions may also be operated and supervised in accordance with Article 76(2)(c) if appropriate.\n\n## This Recital relates to\n\n- [Article 57: AI regulatory sandboxes](/en/ai-act/article-57)\n- [Article 58: Detailed arrangements for, and functioning of, AI regulatory sandboxes](/en/ai-act/article-58)\n- [Article 59: Further processing of personal data for developing certain AI systems in public interest](/en/ai-act/article-59)\n- [Article 62: Measures for providers and deployers](/en/ai-act/article-62)\n- [Article 76: Supervision of testing in real-world conditions](/en/ai-act/article-76)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).

However, in such cases, taking into account the possible consequences of such testing on individuals, it should be ensured that appropriate and sufficient guarantees and conditions are introduced by this Regulation for providers or prospective providers. Such guarantees should include, inter alia, requesting informed consent of natural persons to participate in testing in real world conditions, with the exception of law enforcement where the seeking of informed consent would prevent the AI system from being tested. Consent of subjects to participate in such testing under this Regulation is distinct from, and without prejudice to, consent of data subjects for the processing of their personal data under the relevant data protection law. It is also important to minimise the risks and enable oversight by competent authorities and therefore require prospective providers to have a real-world testing plan submitted to competent market surveillance authority, register the testing in dedicated sections in the EU database subject to some limited exceptions, set limitations on the period for which the testing can be done and require additional safeguards for persons belonging to certain vulnerable groups, as well as a written agreement defining the roles and responsibilities of prospective providers and deployers and effective oversight by competent personnel involved in the real world testing. Furthermore, it is appropriate to envisage additional safeguards to ensure that the predictions, recommendations or decisions of the AI system can be effectively reversed and disregarded and that personal data is protected and is deleted when the subjects have withdrawn their consent to participate in the testing without prejudice to their rights as data subjects under the Union data protection law. As regards transfer of data, it is also appropriate to envisage that data collected and processed for the purpose of testing in real-world conditions should be transferred to third countries only where appropriate and applicable safeguards under Union law are implemented, in particular in accordance with bases for transfer of personal data under Union law on data protection, while for non-personal data appropriate safeguards are put in place in accordance with Union law, such as Regulations (EU) 2022/868(42) and (EU) 2023/2854(43) of the European Parliament and of the Council.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 60: Testing of high-risk AI systems in real world conditions outside AI regulatory sandboxes](/en/ai-act/article-60)\n*   [Article 61: Informed consent to participate in testing in real world conditions outside AI regulatory sandboxes](/en/ai-act/article-61)\n*   [Article 76: Supervision of testing in real world conditions by market surveillance authorities](/en/ai-act/article-76)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).

Where appropriate, these channels should work together to create synergies and ensure homogeneity in their guidance to SMEs, including start-ups, and deployers. Additionally, Member States should facilitate the participation of SMEs and other relevant stakeholders in the standardisation development processes. Moreover, the specific interests and needs of providers that are SMEs, including start-ups, should be taken into account when notified bodies set conformity assessment fees. The Commission should regularly assess the certification and compliance costs for SMEs, including start-ups, through transparent consultations and should work with Member States to lower such costs.

In order to ensure coherent application and enforcement of the obligations under this Regulation and relevant rules and requirements of the Union financial services legal acts, the competent authorities for the supervision and enforcement of those legal acts, in particular competent authorities as defined in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council(46)and Directives 2008/48/EC(47), 2009/138/EC(48), 2013/36/EU(49), 2014/17/EU(50)and (EU) 2016/97(51)of the European Parliament and of the Council, should be designated, within their respective competences, as competent authorities for the purpose of supervising the implementation of this Regulation, including for market surveillance activities, as regards AI systems provided or used by regulated and supervised financial institutions unless Member States decide to designate another authority to fulfil these market surveillance tasks. Those competent authorities should have all powers under this Regulation and Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 to enforce the requirements and obligations of this Regulation, including powers to carry out postmarket surveillance activities that can be integrated, as appropriate, into their existing supervisory mechanisms and procedures under the relevant Union financial services law. It is appropriate to envisage that, when acting as market surveillance authorities under this Regulation, the national authorities responsible for the supervision of credit institutions regulated under Directive 2013/36/EU, which are participating in the Single Supervisory Mechanism established by Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013(52), should report, without delay, to the European Central Bank any information identified in the course of their market surveillance activities that may be of potential interest for the European Central Bank’s prudential supervisory tasks as specified in that Regulation. To further enhance the consistency between this Regulation and the rules applicable to credit institutions regulated under Directive 2013/36/EU, it is also appropriate to integrate some of the providers’ procedural obligations in relation to risk management, postmarketing monitoring and documentation into the existing obligations and procedures under Directive 2013/36/EU. In order to avoid overlaps, limited derogations should also be envisaged in relation to the quality management system of providers and the monitoring obligation placed on deployers of high-risk AI systems to the extent that these apply to credit institutions regulated by Directive 2013/36/EU. The same regime should apply to insurance and reinsurance undertakings and insurance holding companies under Directive 2009/138/EC and other types of financial institutions subject to requirements regarding internal governance, arrangements or processes established pursuant to the relevant Union financial services law to ensure consistency and equal treatment in the financial sector.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 72: Post-market monitoring by providers and post-market monitoring plan for high-risk AI systems](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-72)\n\n## Legal Notice\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).

However, taking into account the unacceptable risk associated with the use of AI in certain ways, the prohibitions as well as the general provisions of this Regulation should already apply from 2 February 2025. While the full effect of those prohibitions follows with the establishment of the governance and enforcement of this Regulation, anticipating the application of the prohibitions is important to take account of unacceptable risks and to have an effect on other procedures, such as in civil law. Moreover, the infrastructure related to the governance and the conformity assessment system should be operational before 2 August 2026, therefore the provisions on notified bodies and governance structure should apply from 2 August 2025. Given the rapid pace of technological advancements and adoption of general-purpose AI models, obligations for providers of general-purpose AI models should apply from 2 August 2025. Codes of practice should be ready by 2 May 2025 in view of enabling providers to demonstrate compliance on time. The AI Office should ensure that classification rules and procedures are up to date in light of technological developments. In addition, Member States should lay down and notify to the Commission the rules on penalties, including administrative fines, and ensure that they are properly and effectively implemented by the date of application of this Regulation. Therefore the provisions on penalties should apply from 2 August 2025.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 113: Entry into force and application](/en/ai-act/article-113)\n\n## Legal Notice\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).

Failure leading to danger threatens health and safety of humans and/or property.\n\n### Definition 15: 'Instructions for Use’\n\n**Definition:** Information provided by the provider informing deployers about the intended purpose and proper use of an AI system.\n\n### Definition 16: 'Recall of an AI System’\n\n**Definition:** Any measure aimed at returning a provider's product to their original state before it was placed on sale. It includes disassembling products if feasible while ensuring no further damage occurs during removal processes.\n\n### Definition 17: 'Withdrawal of an AI System’\n\n**Definition:** Preventing an already placed product from being made available again on sale by removing it from circulation. This involves stopping production operations associated with selling products once they are sold off-market services are discontinued. If there is no longer demand for these services then withdrawal can be considered complete since no new orders will be processed anymore. However if there remains some residual demand for these services then withdrawal cannot be considered complete yet until all remaining orders have been fulfilled. For example if there is still ongoing maintenance work required even though all customers have completed their contracts so long as those contracts remain intact then withdrawal cannot be considered complete yet until all maintenance work has been completed. Similarly if there is still ongoing marketing work required even though all customers have completed their contracts so long as those contracts remain intact then withdrawal cannot be considered complete yet until all marketing work has been completed. Therefore withdrawal can only be considered complete once all ongoing maintenance work has been completed. Once withdrawn from sale it must not be resold again anywhere else in Europe because it has lost its status as compliant with EU law regarding compliance with EU regulations governing compliance assessments etc., hence it must never be rebranded nor marketed under any guise whatsoever just because it was previously branded under another company's name(s).\n\n### Definition 18: 'Performance of an AI System’\n\n**Definition:** Ability to achieve its intended purpose without causing harm to people (including physical injury), property loss (such as destruction), environmental degradation (such as pollution), financial losses (such as loss of income), reputational damages (such as loss of brand recognition), privacy violations (such as unauthorized collection), discrimination (such as unfair treatment based solely on race/color/gender/disability/etc.), harassment (such as offensive comments), exploitation (of vulnerable populations like

It also outlaws certain AI systems used for individual criminal offence risk assessment and prediction based solely on profiling or personality traits and characteristics, untargeted scraping to develop facial recognition databases, emotion recognition and biometric categorization. Real-time remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces for the purposes of law enforcement is also prohibited with some exceptions.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n### 1\\. The following AI practices shall be prohibited:\n\n(a) the placing on the market, the putting into service or the use of an AI system that deploys subliminal techniques beyond a person’s consciousness or purposely manipulative or deceptive techniques, with the objective, or the effect of materially distorting the behavior of a person or a group of persons by appreciably impairing their ability to make an informed decision, thereby causing them to take a decision that they would not have otherwise taken in a manner that causes or is reasonably likely to cause that person, another person or group of persons significant harm;\n\n(b) the placing on the market, the putting into service or the use of an AI system that exploits any of the vulnerabilities of a natural person or a specific group of persons due to their age, disability or a specific social or economic situation, with the objective, or the effect, of materially distorting the behavior of that person or a person belonging to that group in a manner that causes or is reasonably likely to cause that person or another person significant harm;\n\n(c) the placing on the market, the putting into service or the use of an AI system for evaluating or classifying natural persons or groups of persons over a certain period of time based on their social behavior or known, inferred or predicted personal or personality characteristics, with social scores leading to either:\n   - detrimental or unfavorable treatment of certain natural persons or groups of persons in social contexts unrelated to those in which the data was originally generated or collected;\n   - detrimental or unfavorable treatment of certain natural persons or groups of persons that is unjustified or disproportionate to their social behavior and its gravity;\n\n(d) the placing on the market, putting into service for this specific purpose, or using an AI system for making risk assessments of natural persons in order to assess或predict risk levels associated with criminal offenses based solely on profiling individuals based on these profiles alone; this prohibition shall not apply to AI systems used to support human assessments involving individuals in criminal investigations and prosecutions while maintaining links between original crime-related facts directly linked to criminal acts;\n\n(e) placing on the market, putting into service for this specific purpose, using an AI system for analyzing whether someone commits crimes based solely on profiling individuals based solely on these profiles alone;

This system should be a continuous process throughout the high-risk AI system's lifecycle, regularly reviewed and updated. Risk management measures aim to eliminate or reduce risks through design, mitigation, and user information. Testing is required to ensure compliance and performance, with consideration for persons under the age of 18 and vulnerable groups. Providers can integrate these requirements with existing risk management processes under other EU laws.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n## Article 9: Risk management system\n\n### Step 1: Identify and analyze risks\n\nA risk management system shall be established, implemented, documented and maintained in relation to high-risk AI systems. The risk management system shall be understood as a continuous iterative process planned and run throughout the entire lifecycle of a high-risk AI system, requiring regular systematic review and updating. It shall comprise the following steps:\n\n- **(a)** The identification and analysis of the known and the reasonably foreseeable risks that the high-risk AI system can pose to health, safety or fundamental rights when the high-risk AI system is used in accordance with its intended purpose;\n- **(b)** The estimation and evaluation of the risks that may emerge when the high-risk AI system is used in accordance with its intended purpose, and under conditions of reasonably foreseeable misuse;\n- **(c)** The evaluation of other risks possibly arising, based on the analysis of data gathered from the post-market monitoring system referred to in [Article 72](/en/ai-act/article-72);\n- **(d)** The adoption of appropriate and targeted risk management measures designed to address the risks identified pursuant to point (a).\n\n### Step 2: Estimate and evaluate risks\n\nThe risks referred to in this Article shall concern only those which may be reasonably mitigated or eliminated through the development or design of the high-risk AI system, or the provision of adequate technical information.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate other risks\n\nThe risk management measures referred to in paragraph 2, point (d), shall give due consideration to the effects and possible interaction resulting from the combined application of the requirements set out in this Section, with a view to minimizing risks more effectively while achieving an appropriate balance in implementing the measures to fulfill those requirements.\n\n### Step 4: Adopt targeted measures\n\nThe risk management measures referred to in paragraph 2, point (d), shall be such that the relevant residual risk associated with each hazard, as well as the overall residual risk of the high-risk AI systems is judged to be acceptable.\n\nIn identifying the most appropriate risk management measures, the following shall be ensured:\n- Elimination or reduction of risks identified and evaluated pursuant to paragraph 2 in as far as technically feasible through adequate design and development of the high-risk AI system;\n- Where appropriate, implementation of adequate mitigation and control measures addressing risks that cannot be eliminated;\n- Provision of information required pursuant to [Article 13](/en/ai-act/article-13) and, where appropriate, training to deployers.\n\nWith a view to eliminating or reducing risks related to the use of the high-risk AI system, due consideration shall be given to technical knowledge, experience, education, the training to be expected by the deployer, and the presumable context in which the system is intended to be used.\n\n### Step 5: Test for compliance\n\nHigh-risk AI systems shall be tested for purposes of identifying appropriate and targeted risk management measures. Testing shall ensure that high-risk AI systems perform consistently for their intended purpose and that they are compliant with requirements set out in this Section.\n\nTesting procedures may include testing in real-world conditions in accordance with [Article 60](/en/ai-act/article-60).\n\n### Step 6: Perform testing throughout lifecycle\n\nThe testing of high-risk AI systems shall be performed at any time during development process up until placement on market or put into service. Testing shall be carried out against prior defined metrics and probabilistic thresholds appropriate to intended purpose of high-risk AI systems.\n\nWhen implementing risk management system as provided for in paragraphs 1 - 7, providers shall consider whether intended purpose justifies additional testing beyond what is necessary for compliance assurance.\n\n### Step 7: Consider vulnerabilities\n\nFor providers of high-risk AI systems that are subject to requirements regarding internal risk management processes under other relevant provisions under Union law, aspects provided in paragraphs 1 - 9 may form part of or combine with risk management procedures established pursuant thereto.\n\n## Relevant Recitals\n\n*   [Recital 64](/en/ai-act/recital-64)\n*   [Recital 65](/en/ai-act/recital-65)\n*   [Recital 71](/en/ai-act/recital-71)\n\nView official text: [Artificial Intelligence Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).\n```", "fetched_at_utc": "2025-12-29T10:05:39Z", "sha256": "fd92515c9913d557470c2e731fabcb33f2d46e4e92c53683013cd1feaa7d2dba", "meta": {"jina_status": 20000, "jina_code": 200, "description": null, "links": null, "images": null, "usage": {"tokens": 12000}}}

This documentation should be clear and comprehensive, including elements specified in [Annex IV](/en/ai-act/annex-4), with a simplified option for SMEs and start-ups. For AI systems related to products covered by EU harmonisation legislation, a single set of documentation is required. The European Commission can update the documentation requirements to keep pace with technical advancements.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n### 1. The technical documentation of a high-risk AI system shall be drawn up before that system is placed on the market or put into service and shall be kept up-to date.\n\nThe technical documentation shall be drawn up in such a way as to demonstrate that the high-risk AI system complies with the requirements set out in this Section and to provide national competent authorities and notified bodies with the necessary information in a clear and comprehensive form to assess the compliance of the AI system with those requirements. It shall contain, at a minimum, the elements set out in [Annex IV](/en/ai-act/annex-4). SMEs, including start-ups, may provide the elements of the technical documentation specified in [Annex IV](/en/ai-act/annex-4) in a simplified manner. To that end, the Commission shall establish a simplified technical documentation form targeted at the needs of small and microenterprises. Where an SME, including a start-up, opts to provide the information required in [Annex IV](/en/ai-act/annex-4) in a simplified manner, it shall use the form referred to in this paragraph. Notified bodies shall accept the form for the purposes of the conformity assessment.\n\n### 2. Where a high-risk AI system related to a product covered by the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Section A of [Annex I](/en/ai-act/annex-1) is placed on the market or put into service, a single set of technical documentation shall be drawn up containing all the information set out in paragraph 1, as well as the information required under those legal acts.\n\n### 3. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with [Article 97](/en/ai-act/article-97) in order to amend [Annex IV](/en/ai-act/annex-4), where necessary, to ensure that, in light of technical progress, the technical documentation provides all the information necessary to assess the compliance of the system with the requirements set out in this Section.\n\n#### Relevant recitals\n*   [Recital 66](/en/ai-act/recital-66)\n*   [Recital 71](/en/ai-act/recital-71)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/html/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).

Oversight measures should be proportional to the system's risks, autonomy, and context of use, including built-in safeguards and deployer-implemented controls. Humans must be able to monitor, interpret, and override the system, with awareness of potential over-reliance on AI outputs. For remote biometric identification systems, critical decisions must be verified by at least two competent individuals, except in specific law enforcement or border control scenarios.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n1. High-risk AI systems shall be designed and developed in such a way, including with appropriate human-machine interface tools, that they can be effectively overseen by natural persons during the period in which they are in use.\n2. Human oversight shall aim to prevent or minimize the risks to health, safety or fundamental rights that may emerge when a high-risk AI system is used in accordance with its intended purpose or under conditions of reasonably foreseeable misuse, in particular where such risks persist despite the application of other requirements set out in this Section.\n3. The oversight measures shall be commensurate with the risks, level of autonomy and context of use of the high-risk AI system, and shall be ensured through either one or both of the following types of measures:\n   - measures identified and built into the high-risk AI system by the provider before it is placed on the market or put into service;\n   - measures identified by the provider before placing the high-risk AI system on the market or putting it into service and that are appropriate to be implemented by the deployer.\n4. For the purpose of implementing paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, the high-risk AI system shall be provided to the deployer in such a way that natural persons to whom human oversight is assigned are enabled, as appropriate and proportionate:\n   - properly understand the relevant capacities and limitations of the high-risk AI system and be able to duly monitor its operation, including in view of detecting and addressing anomalies, dysfunctions and unexpected performance;\n   - remain aware of the possible tendency of automatically relying or over-relying on the output produced by a high-risk AI system (automation bias), in particular for high-risk AI systems used to provide information or recommendations for decisions to be taken by natural persons;\n   - correctly interpret the high-risk AI system’s output, taking into account, for example, the interpretation tools and methods available;\n   - decide, in any particular situation, not to use the high-risk AI system or to otherwise disregard, override or reverse the output of the high-risk AI system;\n   - intervene in the operation of the high-risk AI system or interrupt the system through a ‘stop’ button or a similar procedure that allows the system to come to a halt in a safe state.\n5. For high-risk AI systems referred to in point 1(a) of [Annex III](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-3), the measures referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article shall be such as to ensure that no action or decision is taken by the deployer on the basis of an identification resulting from the system unless that identification has been separately verified and confirmed by at least two natural persons with necessary competence, training and authority.\n\nThe requirement for a separate verification by at least two natural persons shall not apply to high-risk AI systems used for purposes considered disproportionate due to law enforcement activities like immigration services.\n\n### Relevant Recitals\n- [Recital 27](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-27)\n- [Recital 66](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-66)\n- [Recital 73](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-73)\n- [Recital 91](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-91)\n\nView official text: [Artificial Intelligence Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).\n```", "fetched_at_utc": "2025-12-29T10:07:51Z", "sha256": "2c8cceaa75d9541ba3925e01d0975e0b72810beb6bfbb8296a7171d5714b2a3d", "meta": {"jina_status": 20000, "jina_code": 200, "description": null, "links": null, "images": null, "usage": {"tokens": 12000}}}

The assessment complements existing data protection impact assessments.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n1. Prior to deploying a high-risk AI system referred to in [Article 6(2)](/en/ai-act/article-6), with the exception of high-risk AI systems intended to be used in the area listed in point 2 of [Annex III](/en/ai-act/annex-3), deployers that are bodies governed by public law, or are private entities providing public services, and deployers of high-risk AI systems referred to in points 5 (b) and (c) of [Annex III](/en/ai-act/annex-3), shall perform an assessment of the impact on fundamental rights that the use of such system may produce. For that purpose, deployers shall perform an assessment consisting of:\n\n   - a description of the deployer’s processes in which the high-risk AI system will be used in line with its intended purpose;\n   - a description of the period of time within which, and the frequency with which, each high-risk AI system is intended to be used;\n   - the categories of natural persons and groups likely to be affected by its use in the specific context;\n   - the specific risks of harm likely to have an impact on the categories of natural persons or groups of persons identified pursuant to point (c) of this paragraph, taking into account the information given by the provider pursuant to [Article 13](/en/ai-act/article-13);\n   - a description of the implementation of human oversight measures, according to the instructions for use;\n   - the measures to be taken in the case of the materialisation of those risks, including the arrangements for internal governance and complaint mechanisms.\n\n2. The obligation laid down in paragraph 1 applies to the first use of the high-risk AI system. The deployer may, in similar cases, rely on previously conducted fundamental rights impact assessments or existing impact assessments carried out by provider. If, during the use of the high-risk AI system, the deployer considers that any of the elements listed in paragraph 1 has changed or is no longer up to date, the deployer shall take the necessary steps to update the information.\n\n3. Once the assessment referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article has been performed, the deployer shall notify the market surveillance authority of its results, submitting the filled-out template referred to in paragraph 5 of this Article as part of the notification. In the case referred to in [Article 46(1)](/en/ai-act/article-46), deployers may be exempt from that obligation to notify.\n\n4. If any of the obligations laid down in this Article is already met through the data protection impact assessment conducted pursuant to [Article 35](/en/ai-act/article-35) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or [Article 27](/en/ai-act/article-27) of Directive (EU) 2016/680, the fundamental rights impact assessment referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall complement that data protection impact assessment.\n\n5.

If a notified body decides to stop its conformity assessment activities, it must inform the notifying authority and affected providers immediately, and, in case of planned cessation, at least one year before ceasing operations. The notified body's certificates can remain valid for nine months after it stops, provided another notified body agrees to take over responsibility for the high-risk AI systems. If a notified body no longer meets requirements, the notifying authority will investigate and may restrict, suspend, or withdraw its designation, informing the Commission and other Member States. The notified body must then inform providers within 10 days. The notifying authority will assess the impact on issued certificates, submit a report, and ensure that unduly issued certificates are suspended or withdrawn.

The notifying authority shall notify the Commission and the other Member States of any relevant changes to the notification of a notified body via the electronic notification tool referred to in [Article 30(2)](/en/ai-act/article-30).\n   \n2. The procedures laid down in Articles 29 and 30 shall apply to extensions of the scope of the notification.\n   For changes to the notification other than extensions of its scope, the procedures laid down in paragraphs (3) to (9) shall apply.\n   \n3. Where a notified body decides to cease its conformity assessment activities, it shall inform the notifying authority and the providers concerned as soon as possible and, in the case of a planned cessation, at least one year before ceasing its activities. The certificates of the notified body may remain valid for a period of nine months after cessation of the notified body’s activities, on condition that another notified body has confirmed in writing that it will assume responsibilities for the high-risk AI systems covered by those certificates. The latter notified body shall complete a full assessment of the high-risk AI systems affected by the end of that nine-month-period before issuing new certificates for those systems. Where the notified body has ceased its activity, the notifying authority shall withdraw the designation.\n   \n4. Where a notifying authority has sufficient reason to consider that a notified body no longer meets the requirements laid down in [Article 31](/en/ai-act/article-31), or that it is failing to fulfill its obligations, the notifying authority shall without delay investigate the matter with utmost diligence. In that context, it shall inform the notified body concerned about the objections raised and give it the possibility to make its views known. If the notifying authority comes to conclude that:\n   - (a) The notified body no longer meets requirements laid down in [Article 31](/en/ai-act/article-31) or fails to fulfill obligations.\n   - (b) There is no risk to health, safety or fundamental rights associated with certificates affected by suspension or restriction.\n   - (c) Another qualified notified body assumes immediate responsibility for high-risk AI systems affected by suspension or restriction.\n   Then:\n   - (i) It assesses impact on issued certificates.\n   - (ii) It submits report on findings within three months.\n   - (iii) It requires certified bodies unduly issued be suspended or withdrawn if applicable.\n   - (iv) It informs Commission and Member States about certificates requiring suspension or withdrawal.\n   - (v) It provides national competent authorities with information about certificates affected by suspension or withdrawal.\n   \n5. Withdrawing designation due to cessation:\n   - (a) National competent authority confirms there is no risk.\n   - (b) Another notified body confirms assumption of responsibilities.\n\n6. Upon withdrawal:\n\n7. Certificates remain valid for up to nine months under these circumstances:\n   - (a) National competent authority confirms there is no risk.\n   - (b) Another qualified notified body confirms assumption of responsibilities.\n\n8.

If the authorisation referred to in paragraph 1 is refused, the use of the high-risk AI system shall be stopped with immediate effect and all the results and outputs of such use shall be immediately discarded.\n\n##### 3. The authorisation referred to in paragraph 1 shall be issued only if the market surveillance authority concludes that the high-risk AI system complies with the requirements of Section 2.

Providers must maintain technical documentation and make it available to authorities and providers of AI systems who intend to integrate the general-purpose AI model into their AI systems. They must also put in place a copyright policy and provide a public summary of training data. Open-source general-purpose AI models are exempt from some documentation requirements, unless they are classified as general-purpose AI models with systemic risks. Providers must cooperate with authorities and may use codes of practice to demonstrate compliance until a harmonised standard is published.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n1. Providers of general-purpose AI models shall:\n   - draw up and keep up-to-date the technical documentation of the model, including its training and testing process and the results of its evaluation, which shall contain, at a minimum, the information set out in [Annex XI](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-11) for the purpose of providing it, upon request, to the AI Office and the national competent authorities;\n   - draw up, keep up-to-date and make available information and documentation to providers of AI systems who intend to integrate the general-purpose AI model into their AI systems. Without prejudice to the need to observe and protect intellectual property rights and confidential business information or trade secrets in accordance with Union and national law, the information and documentation shall:\n     - enable providers of AI systems to have a good understanding of the capabilities and limitations of the general-purpose AI model and to comply with their obligations pursuant to this Regulation; and\n     - contain, at a minimum, the elements set out in [Annex XII](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-12);\n   - put in place a policy to comply with Union law on copyright and related rights, and in particular to identify and comply with, including through state-of-the-art technologies, a reservation of rights expressed pursuant to [Article 4(3)](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-4) of Directive (EU) 2019/790;\n   - draw up and make publicly available a sufficiently detailed summary about the content used for training of the general-purpose AI model, according to a template provided by the AI Office.\n\n2. The obligations set out in paragraph 1, points (a) and (b), shall not apply to providers of AI models that are released under a free and open-source licence that allows for the access, usage, modification, and distribution of the model, and whose parameters, including the weights, the information on the model architecture, and the information on model usage, are made publicly available. This exception shall not apply to general-purpose AI models with systemic risks.\n\n3. Providers of general-purpose AI models shall cooperate as necessary with the Commission and the national competent authorities in the exercise of their competences and powers pursuant to this Regulation.\n\n4. Providers of general-purpose AI models may rely on codes of practice within the meaning of [Article 56](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-56) to demonstrate compliance with the obligations set out in paragraph 1 of this Article, until a harmonised standard is published. Compliance with European harmonised standards grants providers the presumption of conformity to the extent that those standards cover those obligations. Providers of general-purpose AI models who do not adhere to an approved code of practice or do not comply with a European harmonised standard shall demonstrate alternative adequate means of compliance for assessment by the Commission.\n\n5. For the purpose of facilitating compliance with [Annex XI](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-11), in particular points 2 (d) and (e) thereof, the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with [Article 97](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-97) to detail measurement and calculation methodologies with a view to allowing for comparable and verifiable documentation.\n\n6. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with [Article 97(2)](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-97) to amend Annexes XI and XII in light of evolving technological developments.\n\n7.

The post-market monitoring system shall actively and systematically collect, document, and analyze relevant data which may be provided by deployers or which may be collected through other sources on the performance of high-risk AI systems throughout their lifetime, and which allow the provider to evaluate the continuous compliance of AI systems with the requirements set out in Chapter III, Section 2. Where relevant, post-market monitoring shall include an analysis of the interaction with other AI systems. This obligation shall not cover sensitive operational data of deployers which are law-enforcement authorities.\n\n3. The post-market monitoring system shall be based on a post-market monitoring plan. The post-market monitoring plan shall be part of the technical documentation referred to in [Annex IV](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-4). The Commission shall adopt an implementing act laying down detailed provisions establishing a template for the post-market monitoring plan and the list of elements to be included in the plan by 2 February 2026. That implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in [Article 98(2)](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-98).\n\n4. For high-risk AI systems covered by the Union harmonization legislation listed in Section A of [Annex I](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-1), where a post-market monitoring system and plan are already established under that legislation, in order to ensure consistency, avoid duplications, and minimize additional burdens, providers shall have a choice of integrating, as appropriate, the necessary elements described in paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 using the template referred in paragraph 3 into systems and plans already existing under that legislation, provided that it achieves an equivalent level of protection.\n\n   The first subparagraph of this paragraph shall also apply to high-risk AI systems referred to in point 5 of [Annex III](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-3) placed on the market or put into service by financial institutions that are subject to requirements under Union financial services law regarding their internal governance, arrangements or processes.\n\n### Relevant Recitals\n\n* [Recital 71](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-71)\n* [Recital 155](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-155)\n* [Recital 158](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-158)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).

If an AI system is deemed to present a risk, the authority will evaluate its compliance with the AI Act, with particular attention on risks to vulnerable groups. If non-compliance is found, the authority will require corrective actions, including potential withdrawal or recall of the AI system.

Particular attention shall be given to AI systems presenting a risk to vulnerable groups. Where risks to fundamental rights are identified, the market surveillance authority shall also inform and fully cooperate with the relevant national public authorities or bodies referred to in [Article 77(1)](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-77).

In any event, within 15 working days after receiving notification about non-compliance or within 30 days after discovery of serious non-compliance.\n\n   The market surveillance authority shall inform the relevant notified body accordingly. [Article 18](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-18) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 shall apply to measures taken under paragraph 2.\n\n3.

The Commission can appoint independent experts to perform these evaluations and request access to the AI model through APIs or other technical means, including source code. Providers must comply with these requests or face fines. Before requesting access, the AI Office may engage in a structured dialogue with the provider to gather more information.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n### 1. The AI Office, after consulting the Board, may conduct evaluations of the general-purpose AI model concerned:\n   - (a) to assess compliance of the provider with obligations under this Regulation, where the information gathered pursuant to [Article 91](/en/ai-act/article-91) is insufficient; or\n   - (b) to investigate systemic risks at Union level of general-purpose AI models with systemic risk, in particular following a qualified alert from the scientific panel in accordance with [Article 90(1)](/en/ai-act/article-90), point (a).\n\n### 2. The Commission may decide to appoint independent experts to carry out evaluations on its behalf, including from the scientific panel established pursuant to [Article 68](/en/ai-act/article-68). Independent experts appointed for this task shall meet the criteria outlined in [Article 68(2)](/en/ai-act/article-68).\n\n### 3. For the purposes of paragraph 1, the Commission may request access to the general-purpose AI model concerned through APIs or further appropriate technical means and tools, including source code.\n\n### 4. The request for access shall state the legal basis, the purpose and reasons of the request and set the period within which the access is to be provided, and the fines provided for in [Article 101](/en/ai-act/article-101) for failure to provide access.\n\n### 5. The providers of the general-purpose AI model concerned or its representative shall supply the information requested. In the case of legal persons, companies or firms, or where the provider has no legal personality, the persons authorised to represent them by law or by their statutes, shall provide the access requested on behalf of the provider of the general-purpose AI model concerned.\n\n### 6. The Commission shall adopt implementing acts setting out the detailed arrangements and conditions for the evaluations, including detailed arrangements for involving independent experts, and a procedure for selecting thereof. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in [Article 98(2)](/en/ai-act/article-98).\n\n### 7. Prior to requesting access to the general-purpose AI model concerned, the AI Office may initiate a structured dialogue with the provider of the general-purpose AI model to gather more information on internal testing of the model, internal safeguards for preventing systemic risks, and other internal procedures and measures taken by that provider to mitigate such risks.\n\n## Relevant recitals\n* [Recital 161](/en/ai-act/recital-161)\n* [Recital 164](/en/ai-act/recital-164)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).

Where necessary and appropriate, the Commission may request providers to:\n\n   - take appropriate measures to comply with the obligations set out in Articles 53 and 54;\n   - implement mitigation measures, where the evaluation carried out in accordance with [Article 92](/en/ai-act/article-92) has given rise to serious and substantiated concern of a systemic risk at Union level;\n   - restrict the making available on the market, withdraw or recall the model.\n\n2. Before a measure is requested, the AI Office may initiate a structured dialogue with the provider of the general-purpose AI model.\n\n3. If, during the structured dialogue referred to in paragraph 2, the provider of the general-purpose AI model with systemic risk offers commitments to implement mitigation measures to address a systemic risk at Union level, the Commission may, by decision, make those commitments binding and declare that there are no further grounds for action.\n\n### Relevant recitals\n\n- [Recital 162](/en/ai-act/recital-162)\n- [Recital 164](/en/ai-act/recital-164)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).
