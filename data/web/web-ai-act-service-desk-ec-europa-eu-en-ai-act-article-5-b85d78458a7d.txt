# Article 5: Prohibited AI practices

## Summary

[Article 5](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-5) prohibits the placing on the EU market, putting into service or use of certain AI systems for manipulative, exploitative and social scoring practices, which by their inherent nature violate fundamental rights and EU values. It also outlaws certain AI systems used for individual criminal offence risk assessment and prediction based solely on profiling or personality traits and characteristics, untargeted scraping to develop facial recognition databases, emotion recognition and biometric categorization. Real-time remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces for the purposes of law enforcement is also prohibited with some exceptions.

The summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.

### 1\. The following AI practices shall be prohibited:

(a) the placing on the market, the putting into service or the use of an AI system that deploys subliminal techniques beyond a person’s consciousness or purposely manipulative or deceptive techniques, with the objective, or the effect of materially distorting the behavior of a person or a group of persons by appreciably impairing their ability to make an informed decision, thereby causing them to take a decision that they would not have otherwise taken in a manner that causes or is reasonably likely to cause that person, another person or group of persons significant harm;

(b) the placing on the market, the putting into service or the use of an AI system that exploits any of the vulnerabilities of a natural person or a specific group of persons due to their age, disability or a specific social or economic situation, with the objective, or the effect, of materially distorting the behavior of that person or a person belonging to that group in a manner that causes or is reasonably likely to cause that person or another person significant harm;

(c) the placing on the market, the putting into service or the use of an AI system for evaluating or classifying natural persons or groups of persons over a certain period of time based on their social behavior or known, inferred or predicted personal or personality characteristics, with social scores leading to either:
   - detrimental or unfavorable treatment of certain natural persons or groups of persons in social contexts unrelated to those in which the data was originally generated or collected;
   - detrimental or unfavorable treatment of certain natural persons or groups of persons that is unjustified or disproportionate to their social behavior and its gravity;

(d) the placing on the market, putting into service for this specific purpose, or using an AI system for making risk assessments of natural persons in order to assess或predict risk levels associated with criminal offenses based solely on profiling individuals based on these profiles alone; this prohibition shall not apply to AI systems used to support human assessments involving individuals in criminal investigations and prosecutions while maintaining links between original crime-related facts directly linked to criminal acts;

(e) placing on the market, putting into service for this specific purpose, using an AI system for analyzing whether someone commits crimes based solely on profiling individuals based solely on these profiles alone; this prohibition shall not apply to AI systems used to support human assessments involving individuals in criminal investigations and prosecutions while maintaining links between original crime-related facts directly linked to criminal acts;

(f) placing on the market, putting into service for this specific purpose using an AI system for creating databases containing facial images obtained through untargeted scraping from online sources;

(g) placing on the market, putting into service for this specific purpose using an AI system for inferring emotions from natural people's faces in educational settings and workplaces excluding situations aimed at identifying potential victims of kidnapping, trafficking in humans, sexual exploitation etc., unless such use serves legitimate purposes such as targeted searches for abducted children etc.; this prohibition excludes labeling and filtering biometric datasets acquired legally without linking them directly to criminal acts;

(h) using 'real-time' remote biometric identification systems in public places primarily designed for law enforcement purposes under strict authorization conditions; authorized uses must be limited by temporal duration and geographical coverage.

**Note:** Point (h) applies only when necessary and proportionate under national law authorizing these uses.

#### Use Conditions

Each real-time remote biometric identification system authorized under paragraph 1 h can be used only if it meets several criteria:
- The need for such usage must be justified by objective evidence.
- The consequences arising from its use must be considered carefully.
- The extent and scope covered by these systems must be limited.
- Only necessary actions should be carried out.
- Safeguards must be implemented regarding privacy concerns.
- Users must report any misuse promptly.

#### Authorization Process

To authorize real-time remote biometric identification systems:
- Requests must come from judicial authorities.
- An independent administrative authority must issue binding decisions.
- These decisions are legally binding across Member States.
- Each authorization requires thorough rights impact assessments conducted by competent authorities.
- Notifications must follow national regulations.

#### Notification Requirements

Notifications must include:
- Information about how many applications were approved.
- Details about why they were granted.
- Data submitted during each approval process.

#### Annual Reports

Annual reports will be published by:
- The Commission annually.
- They will not include sensitive operational data.
