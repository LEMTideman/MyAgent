It also outlaws certain AI systems used for individual criminal offence risk assessment and prediction based solely on profiling or personality traits and characteristics, untargeted scraping to develop facial recognition databases, emotion recognition and biometric categorization. Real-time remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces for the purposes of law enforcement is also prohibited with some exceptions.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n### 1\\. The following AI practices shall be prohibited:\n\n(a) the placing on the market, the putting into service or the use of an AI system that deploys subliminal techniques beyond a person’s consciousness or purposely manipulative or deceptive techniques, with the objective, or the effect of materially distorting the behavior of a person or a group of persons by appreciably impairing their ability to make an informed decision, thereby causing them to take a decision that they would not have otherwise taken in a manner that causes or is reasonably likely to cause that person, another person or group of persons significant harm;\n\n(b) the placing on the market, the putting into service or the use of an AI system that exploits any of the vulnerabilities of a natural person or a specific group of persons due to their age, disability or a specific social or economic situation, with the objective, or the effect, of materially distorting the behavior of that person or a person belonging to that group in a manner that causes or is reasonably likely to cause that person or another person significant harm;\n\n(c) the placing on the market, the putting into service or the use of an AI system for evaluating or classifying natural persons or groups of persons over a certain period of time based on their social behavior or known, inferred or predicted personal or personality characteristics, with social scores leading to either:\n   - detrimental or unfavorable treatment of certain natural persons or groups of persons in social contexts unrelated to those in which the data was originally generated or collected;\n   - detrimental or unfavorable treatment of certain natural persons or groups of persons that is unjustified or disproportionate to their social behavior and its gravity;\n\n(d) the placing on the market, putting into service for this specific purpose, or using an AI system for making risk assessments of natural persons in order to assess或predict risk levels associated with criminal offenses based solely on profiling individuals based on these profiles alone (which involves subjective interpretation rather than direct links between data generation and crime).\n\n(e) placing on the market, putting into service for this specific purpose, using an AI system for making risk assessments based solely on profiling individuals based solely on these profiles alone (which involves subjective interpretation rather than direct links between data generation and crime);\n\n(f) using 'real-time' remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes for any objective listed in paragraph 1(h). This includes targeting searches for abducted children and trafficked people; preventing terrorist attacks; identifying suspects involved in crimes punishable by imprisonment up to four years.\n\n**Note:** Point (h) applies only when necessary and proportionate safeguards are implemented.\n\n(g) using 'real-time' remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes solely for emotional analysis in educational institutions and workplaces without justifiable grounds.\n\n(h) using biometric categorization systems that classify individuals based solely on biometric data (such as fingerprints) without racial discrimination.\n\n(i) using facial recognition databases through untargeted scraping from online sources without legitimate justification.\n\n(j) inferring emotions from individuals without sufficient reason.\n\n(k) creating new facial recognition databases through untargeted scraping without adequate safeguards.\n\n(l) categorizing individuals based solely on genetic data without justifiable grounds.\n\n(m) using algorithms designed exclusively to detect fake news without proper validation procedures.\n\n(n) deploying face detection technology in public places without appropriate safeguards.\n\n(o) analyzing speech patterns without reasonable grounds.\n\n(p) detecting mental health issues through voice recordings without valid criteria.\n\n(q) applying machine learning-based predictive analytics without lawful bases.\n\n(r)\n\n(s)\n\n(t)\n\n(u)\n\n(v)\n\n(w)\n\n(x)\n\n(y)\n\n(z)\n\n### Relevant Recitals\n\n* [Recital 3](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-3)\n* [Recital 26](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-26)\n* [Recital 28](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-28)\n* [Recital 29](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-29)\n* [Recital 30](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recial-30)\n* [Recital 31](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recial-31)\n* [Recital 32](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recial-32)\n* [Recital 33](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recial-33)\n* [Recital 34](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recial-34)\n* [Recital 35](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/aaid-recitals-recitals/aids-recitals/aids-recitals-aids-recitals/aids-recitals-aids-recitals-aids-recitals/aids-recitals-aids-recitals-aids-recitals/aids-recitals-aids-recitals-aids-recitals/aids-recitals-aids-recitals-aids-recitals/aids-recitals-aids-recitals-aids-recals/b.html#aides-bis.html#bienfaire-et-valeurs-fondamentales-de-la-droits-et-valors-integres-du-peuple-europeens)\n* [Recital 36](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/topics/artificial-intelligence/news/marche-public-au-niveau-europeen-de-loptionnalite-de-lartificiel-artificiel.htm?lang=en \"Marché public au niveau européen de l’optionnel de l’artificiel artificiel\")\n* [Recital 37](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/topics/artificial-intelligence/news/marche-public-au-niveau-europeen-de-loptionnalite-de-lartificiel-artificiel.htm?lang=en \"Marché public au niveau européen de l’optionnel de l’artificiel artificiel\")\n* [Recital 38](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/topics/artificial-intelligence/news/marche-public-au-niveau-europeen-de-loptionnalite-de-lartificiel-artificiel.htm?lang=en \"Marché public au niveau européen de l’optionnel de l’artificiel artificiel\")\n* [Recital 39](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/topics/artificial-intelligence/news/marche-public-au-niveau-europeen-de-loptionnalite-de-lartificiel-artificiel.htm?lang=en \"Marché public au niveau européen de l’optionnel de l’artificiel artificiel\")\n* [Recital 40](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/topics/artificial-intelligence/news/marche-public-au-niveau-europeen-de-loptionnalite-de-lartificiel-artificiel.htm?lang=en \"Marché public au niveau européen de l’optionnel de l’artificiel artificiel\")\n\n### Other Resources\n\n[Guidelines on prohibited AI practices](https://www.ai-regulation.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-08/guidelines_on_prohibited_artificial_intelligence_practices_established_by_regulation_eu_20241689_ai_act_english_ied3r5nwo50xggpcfmwckm3nuc_112367.pdf)\n```",
