# Annex IV

The technical documentation referred to in [Article 11(1)](/en/ai-act/article-11) shall contain at least the following information, as applicable to the relevant AI system:

## Table 1: General Description and Functionality Details

### 1. A general description of the AI system including:
- Its intended purpose, the name of the provider and the version of the system reflecting its relation to previous versions;
- How the AI system interacts with, or can be used to interact with, hardware or software, including with other AI systems, that are not part of the AI system itself, where applicable;
- The versions of relevant software or firmware, and any requirements related to version updates;
- The description of all the forms in which the AI system is placed on the market or put into service, such as software packages embedded into hardware, downloads, or APIs;
- The description of the hardware on which the AI system is intended to run;
- Where the AI system is a component of products, photographs or illustrations showing external features, the marking and internal layout of those products;
- A basic description of the user-interface provided to the deployer;
- Instructions for use for the deployer, and a basic description of the user-interface provided to the deployer, where applicable;

### 2. A detailed description of the elements of the AI system and of the process for its development, including:
- Methods and steps performed for the development of the AI system, including, where relevant, recourse to pre-trained systems or tools provided by third parties and how those were used, integrated or modified by the provider;
- The design specifications of the system, namely the general logic of the AI system and of the algorithms; key design choices including the rationale and assumptions made, including with regard to persons or groups of persons in respect of who, the system is intended to be used; main classification choices; what the system is designed to optimize for; and whether there are potential trade-offs between technical solutions adopted to comply with Chapter III’s requirements;
- The description of software components building on or feeding into each other and integrating into overall processing; computational resources used during development,
- Where relevant: Data requirements in terms of datasheets describing training methodologies and techniques and training data sets used (including descriptions about data sets), information about their provenance (scope), selection criteria (labelling procedures), data cleaning methodologies (outliers detection);
- Assessment of human oversight measures needed in accordance with Article 14; technical measures put in place to facilitate interpreting outputs by deployers according to Article 13(3)(d);
- Where applicable: Detailed description of pre-determined changes to systems and their performance as per Article 14(3)(f), validation/testing procedures,
- Cybersecurity measures put in place;

### 3. Detailed information about monitoring functions:
- Capabilities and limitations in performance,

- Fundamental rights impact assessment due to intended purposes,
- Human oversight measures required in accordance with Article 14,
- Specifications on input data,

### 4. A description of appropriateness for performance metrics chosen.

### 5. A detailed description of risk management systems implemented.

### 6. A description of changes made by provider throughout its lifecycle.

### 7. List details harmonized standards applied in full or partially with corresponding references published in _Official Journal_.

### 8. Copy details on systems implementing evaluation performance metrics post-market phase.
