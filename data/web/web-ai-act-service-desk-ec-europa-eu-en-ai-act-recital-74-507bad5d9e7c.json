The Commission and relevant organizations and stakeholders are encouraged to take due consideration of the mitigation of risks and the negative impacts of the AI system. The expected level of performance metrics should be declared in the accompanying instructions of use. Providers are urged to communicate that information to deployers in a clear and easily understandable way, free of misunderstandings or misleading statements. Union law on legal metrology, including Directives 2014/31/EU(35) and 2014/32/EU(36) of the European Parliament and of the Council, aims to ensure the accuracy of measurements and to help the transparency and fairness of commercial transactions. In that context, in cooperation with relevant stakeholders and organization, such as metrology and benchmarking authorities, the Commission should encourage, as appropriate, the development of benchmarks and measurement methodologies for AI systems. In doing so, the Commission should take note and collaborate with international partners working on metrology and relevant measurement indicators relating to AI.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 13: Transparency and provision of information to deployers](/en/ai-act/article-13)\n*   [Article 15: Accuracy, robustness and cybersecurity](/en/ai-act/article-15)\n\n---\n\n## Contact Us\n\n*   [Contact the AI Office](mailto:CNECT-AIOFFICE@ec.europa.eu)\n\n## About Us\n\n*   [Copyright notice](/en/copyright-notice)\n*   [Legal notice](/en/legal-notice)\n*   [Privacy statement](/en/privacy-statement-ai-act-service-desk-website)\n*   [About Directorate-General CONNECT](https://commission.europa.eu/about-departments-and-executive-agencies/communications-networks-content-and-technology_en)\n\n[![European Commission Logo](https://webtools.europa.eu/images/flags/eu.svg)](https://commission.europa.eu/index_en)\n\n## Social Media Links\n\n*   [Contact Directorate-General CONNECT](https://commission.europa.eu/about-european-commission/contact_en)\n*   [Follow European Commission on social media](https://european-union.europa.eu/contact-eu/social-media-channels_en#/search?page=0&institutions=european_commission)\n*   [Resources for partners](https://commission.europa.eu/resources-partners_en)\n*   [Report an IT vulnerability](https://commission.europa.eu/legal-notice/vulnerability-disclosure-policy_en)\n\n## Legal Notice\n\n*   [Languages on our websites](https://commission.europa.eu/languages-our-websites_en)\n*   [Cookies](https://commission.europa.eu/cookies_en)\n*   [Privacy policy](https://commission.europa.eu/privacy-policy_en)\n*   [Legal notice](https://commission.europa.eu/legal-notice_en)\n```",
