* The provided HTML contains multiple sections and links related to "Chapter I: General Provisions," but the draft Markdown only includes the first section ("Recitals"). Therefore, the rest of the content has been excluded.
* The actual JSON response would include additional sections like "Chapter II: Prohibited AI Practices," "Chapter III: High-Risk AI Systems," etc., which have not been included in the draft Markdown.
