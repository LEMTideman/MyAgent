If objections arise within specified timeframes, the Commission consults with relevant authorities and operators to evaluate the national measure. If the measure is deemed justified, all Member States must take appropriate restrictive actions. If unjustified, the Member State must withdraw the measure. If the non-compliance is due to shortcomings in harmonised standards, the Commission will follow the procedure outlined in [Article 11](/en/ai-act/article-11) of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n## Article 81: Union safeguard procedure\n\n### Section 3: Enforcement\n\n#### 1.
