# Article 48: CE marking

## Chapter III: High-Risk AI Systems
### Section 5: Standards, Conformity Assessment, Certificates, Registration

### Summary
High-risk AI systems should include CE marking. For AI systems provided digitally, a digital CE marking must be easily accessible. The CE marking must be clearly visible and permanent, or affixed to the packaging or documentation if not possible. Where applicable, the marking should include the identification number of the notified body responsible for conformity assessment. If the AI system is subject to other EU laws requiring CE marking, the marking must indicate compliance with those laws as well.

The summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.
