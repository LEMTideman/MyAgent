  "text": "```markdown\n# Article 90: Alerts of systemic risks by the scientific panel\n\n## Summary\n\nThis article describes the process for the scientific panel to issue a qualified alert to the AI Office if it suspects that a general-purpose AI model poses a concrete risk or meets specific conditions referred to in [Article 51](/en/ai-act/article-51) related to general-purpose AI models with systemic risk. The European Commission can then assess the matter and take appropriate measures.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n## Relevant Recitals\n\n*   [Recital 113](/en/ai-act/recital-113)\n*   [Recital 163](/en/ai-act/recital-163)\n\n## Article 90: Alerts of systemic risks by the scientific panel\n\n### Requiring Qualified Alerts\n\nThe scientific panel may provide a qualified alert to the AI Office where it has reason to suspect that:\n\n(a) a general-purpose AI model poses concrete identifiable risk at Union level; or\n\n(b) a general-purpose AI model meets the conditions referred to in [Article 51](/en/ai-act/article-51).\n\n### Actions Upon Alert\n\nUpon such qualified alert, the Commission, through the AI Office and after having informed the Board, may exercise the powers laid down in this Section for the purpose of assessing the matter. The AI Office shall inform the Board of any measure according to Articles 91 to 94.\n\n### Reasonable Reasons for Alert\n\nA qualified alert shall be duly reasoned and indicate at least:\n(a) the point of contact of the provider of the general-purpose AI model with systemic risk concerned;\n(b) a description of the relevant facts and the reasons for the alert by the scientific panel;\n(c) any other information that the scientific panel considers to be relevant, including, where appropriate, information gathered on its own initiative.\n```",
