The panel's role includes advising the AI Office on risks and methodologies related to AI, assisting with market surveillance, and supporting cross-border activities. Experts must work independently, protect confidential information, and declare any interests to avoid conflicts.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n1. The Commission shall, by means of an implementing act, make provisions on the establishment of a scientific panel of independent experts (the ‘scientific panel’) intended to support the enforcement activities under this Regulation.
