Failure in these functions can lead to serious health and safety consequences.\n\n### Definition 15: ‘Instructions for Use’\n\n**Definition**: Information provided by the provider to inform users about what an AI system's intended purpose is and proper usage methods.\n\n### Definition 16: ‘Recall of an AI System’\n\n**Definition**: Any measure aimed at achieving immediate removal from service if needed due to concerns regarding compliance with required requirements set out in Chapter III Section 2.\n\n### Definition 17: ‘Withdrawal of an AI System’\n\n**Definition**: Any measure aimed at preventing further availability if there is no longer intent to continue using it within its original context.\n\n### Definition 18: ‘Performance of an AI System’\n\n**Definition**: Ability to achieve its intended purpose effectively without causing unintended side effects like malfunctions (failure).\n\n### Definition 19: ‘Notifying Authority’\n\n**Definition**: National authority responsible for setting up and implementing necessary procedures for assessing conformity assessment bodies and monitoring them according to relevant Union harmonization legislation.\n\n### Definition 20: ‘Conformity Assessment’\n\n**Definition**: Process demonstrating whether requirements set out in Chapter III Section 2 relating to high-risk systems have been fulfilled. This includes testing services (certification), inspections etc., performed by third parties certified under this regulation and other relevant harmonized legislation providing means to comply with certain requirements established under this Regulation.\n\n### Definition 21: ‘Conformity Assessment Body’\n\n**Definition**: Third-party organization conducting tests related to conformity assessments. It must meet specific criteria outlined in Directive (EU) No. 2014/90/EU and Directive (EU) No. 2016/797 concerning artificial intelligence systems as defined hereunder. These organizations must be notified via Annex III before they can begin testing activities under this Regulation and other relevant harmonization legislation provisions requiring their registration status. They must also maintain confidentiality agreements with those involved in their testing activities while they are engaged in such activities. There are some exceptions where they can share confidential information among themselves without violating privacy laws because they are working together with another entity authorized by law to perform similar functions. They cannot disclose sensitive operational data unless specifically requested by law enforcement authorities acting within their jurisdictional limits. They should also ensure adequate safeguards against unauthorized access to protected data during testing activities conducted outside regulated areas like laboratories but outside real-world conditions where data collection occurs remotely without significant delays so as not to compromise investigations into crimes punishable by criminal sanctions. For example:\n\n* **Remote Biometric Identification Systems**\n* **Real-Time Remote Biometric Identification Systems**\n\nThese types include remote biometric identification systems where all steps occur without significant delays like instant identification combined with minimal short-term delays aimed at avoiding circumvention issues due to potential threats posed by criminals seeking evasion tactics when investigating crimes punishable by criminal sanctions. Real-time remote biometric identification systems require instant identification followed by minimal short-term delays rather than long-term delays associated with traditional laboratory-based approaches focusing solely on detecting suspicious patterns indicative of malicious activity prior to confirmation through additional checks beyond mere visual comparisons between captured biometrics from subjects compared against stored reference databases containing biometric profiles derived from previous participants participating voluntarily within controlled settings known as \"sandbox plans\". These types involve multiple stages starting with rapid identification followed by brief periods allowing investigators examining evidence gathered earlier during pre-testing phases conducted elsewhere away from typical operating environments often situated indoors near computer terminals connected online networks potentially facilitating illicit transactions facilitated through sophisticated techniques exploiting vulnerabilities inherent within digital ecosystems susceptible only when exploited successfully once identified accurately enough enabling successful deception leading ultimately towards financial gains achievable only through manipulation deceive others thereby evading justice thus posing severe threat undermining trust among citizens necessitating swift
