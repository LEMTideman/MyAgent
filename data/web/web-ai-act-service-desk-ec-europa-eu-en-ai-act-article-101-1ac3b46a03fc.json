The Commission may impose on providers of general-purpose AI models fines not exceeding 3% of their annual total worldwide turnover in the preceding financial year or EUR 15 million, whichever is higher, when the Commission finds that the provider intentionally or negligently:\n\n   - (a) infringed the relevant provisions of this Regulation;\n   - (b) failed to comply with a request for a document or for information pursuant to [Article 91](/en/ai-act/article-91), or supplied incorrect, incomplete or misleading information;\n   - (c) failed to comply with a measure requested under [Article 93](/en/ai-act/article-93);\n   - (d) failed to make available to the Commission access to the general-purpose AI model or general-purpose AI model with systemic risk with a view to conducting an evaluation pursuant to [Article 92](/en/ai-act/article-92).\n\nIn fixing the amount of the fine or periodic penalty payment, regard shall be had to the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement, taking due account of the principles of proportionality and appropriateness. The Commission shall also take into account commitments made in accordance with [Article 93(3)](/en/ai-act/article-93) or made in relevant codes of practice in accordance with [Article 56](/en/ai-act/article-56).\n\n2. Before adopting the decision pursuant to paragraph 1, the Commission shall communicate its preliminary findings to the provider of the general-purpose AI model and give it an opportunity to be heard.\n\n3. Fines imposed in accordance with this Article shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n\n4. Information on fines imposed under this Article shall also be communicated to the Board as appropriate.\n\n5. The Court of Justice of the European Union shall have unlimited jurisdiction to review decisions of the Commission fixing a fine under this Article. It may cancel, reduce or increase the fine imposed.\n\n6. The Commission shall adopt implementing acts containing detailed arrangements and procedural safeguards for proceedings in view of the possible adoption of decisions pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in [Article 98(2)](/en/ai-act/article-98).\n\n### Relevant Recitals\n\n* [Recital 169](/en/ai-act/recital-169)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).
