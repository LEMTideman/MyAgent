Every four years, the Commission will evaluate the regulation's effectiveness. Reports will be submitted to the European Parliament and the Council. The Commission will also evaluate the AI Office's functioning, standardisation progress, and the impact of voluntary codes of conduct.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n1. The Commission shall assess the need for amendment of the list set out in [Annex III](/en/ai-act/annex-3) and of the list of prohibited AI practices laid down in [Article 5](/en/ai-act/article-5), once a year following the entry into force of this Regulation, and until the end of the period of the delegation of power laid down in [Article 97](/en/ai-act/article-97). The Commission shall submit the findings of that assessment to the European Parliament and the Council.\n\n2. By 2 August 2028 and every four years thereafter, the Commission shall evaluate and report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the following:\n\n   - (a) The need for amendments extending existing area headings or adding new area headings in [Annex III](/en/ai-act/annex-3);\n   - (b) Amendments to the list of AI systems requiring additional transparency measures in [Article 50](/en/ai-act/article-50);\n   - (c) Amendments enhancing the effectiveness of the supervision and governance system.\n\n3. By 2 August 2029 and every four years thereafter, the Commission shall submit a report on the evaluation and review of this Regulation to the European Parliament and to the Council. The report shall include an assessment with regard to:\n   \n   - (a) The status of financial, technical, and human resources of national competent authorities in order to effectively perform their tasks under this Regulation;\n   - (b) The state of penalties, in particular administrative fines as referred to in [Article 99(1)](/en/ai-act/article-99), applied by Member States for infringements of this Regulation;\n   - (c) Adopted harmonised standards and common specifications developed to support this Regulation;\n   - (d) The number of undertakings that enter the market after the entry into application of this Regulation, and how many of them are SMEs.\n\n4. By 2 August 2028, the Commission shall evaluate the functioning of the AI Office, whether its activities have been given sufficient powers and competences to fulfill its tasks, and whether it would be relevant and needed for proper implementation and enforcement under this Regulation to upgrade its functions. The Commission shall submit a report on its evaluation to both houses within one year.\n\n5. By 2 August 2028 and every four years thereafter, the Commission shall submit a report on reviewing compliance with regulations regarding energy-efficient development for general-purpose AI models. This report should address potential needs for further measures or actions, including binding measures or actions.\n\n6. By 2 August 2028 and every three years thereafter, it must evaluate impacts on privacy related requirements for voluntary codes such as those set out in Chapter III Section 2.\n\n7. For reviews mentioned above, it must consider positions from various bodies or sources.\n\n8. To guide these evaluations, it must develop an objective methodology based on criteria outlined in relevant Articles.\n\n9. Any amendment to this Regulation concerning sectoral Union harmonization legislation should take into account regulatory specifics within each sector.\n\n10. By 2 August 2031, it must carry out an assessment evaluating enforcement under this Regulation before submitting a proposal for amendment based on findings.\n\n### Relevant Recitals\n\n* [Recital 174](/en/ai-act/recital-174)\n\nView: [Official Text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689)\n```",
