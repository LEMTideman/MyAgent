## Summary

[Article 3](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-3) of the AI Act provides definitions for terms used throughout the AI Act.

The summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.

### Definition 1: 'AI system'

**Definition:** A machine-based system that is designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy and that may exhibit adaptiveness after deployment, and that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments.

### Definition 2: 'Risk'

**Definition:** The combination of the probability of an occurrence of harm and the severity of that harm.

### Definition 3: 'Provider'

**Definition:** A natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body that develops an AI system or a general-purpose AI model or that has an AI system or a general-purpose AI model developed and places it on the market or puts the AI system into service under its own name or trademark, whether for payment or free of charge.

### Definition 4: 'Deployer'

**Definition:** A natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body using an AI system under its authority except where the AI system is used in the course of a personal non-professional activity.

### Definition 5: 'Authorised Representative'

**Definition:** A natural or legal person located or established in the Union who has received and accepted a written mandate from a provider of an AI system or a general-purpose AI model to perform and carry out on its behalf the obligations and procedures established by this Regulation.

### Definition 6: 'Importer'

**Definition:** A natural or legal person located or established in the Union that places on the market an AI system that bears the name or trademark of a natural or legal person established in a third country.

### Definition 7: 'Distributor'

**Definition:** A natural or legal person in the supply chain, other than the provider or the importer, that makes an AI system available on the Union market.

### Definition 8: 'Operator'

**Definition:** A provider, product manufacturer, deployer, authorised representative, importer or distributor.

### Definition 9: 'Placing on the Market'

**Definition:** The first making available of an AI system or a general-purpose AI model on the Union market.

### Definition 10: 'Making Available on the Market'

**Definition:** The supply of an AI system or a general-purpose AI model for distribution or use on the Union market in the course of a commercial activity, whether in return for payment or free of charge.

### Definition 11: 'Putting into Service'

**Definition:** The supply of an AI system for first use directly to the deployer or for own use in the Union for its intended purpose.

### Definition 12: 'Intended Purpose'

**Definition:** The use for which an AI系统是设计的，包括预期的使用场景和条件。

### Definition 13: 'Reasonably Foreseeable Misuse’

**Definition**: Use of an AI system in a way that is not in accordance with its intended purpose but may result from reasonably foreseeable human behavior or interactions with other systems, including other AI systems.

### Definition 14: 'Safety Component’

**Definition**: A component of a product (or general-purpose AI model) which fulfills a safety function for that product (or general-purpose AI model), ensuring it meets basic safety needs. Failure in these functions can lead to serious health and safety consequences.

### Definition 15: ‘Instructions for Use’

**Definition**: Information provided by the provider to inform users about what an AI system's intended purpose is and proper usage methods.

### Definition 16: ‘Recall of an AI System’

**Definition**: Any measure aimed at achieving immediate removal from service if needed due to concerns regarding compliance with required requirements set out in Chapter III Section 2.

### Definition 17: ‘Withdrawal of an AI System’

**Definition**: Any measure aimed at preventing further availability if there were issues with compliance with required requirements set out in Chapter III Section 2 leading to modifications to its intended purpose.

### Definition 18: ‘Performance of an AI System’

**Definition**: Ability to achieve its intended purpose effectively without causing unintended side effects like malfunctions affecting health and safety.

### Definition 19: ‘Notifying Authority’

**Definition**: National authority responsible for setting up and implementing necessary procedures for assessing conformity assessment bodies and monitoring them according to relevant Union harmonization legislation provisions related to conformity assessments.

### Definition 20: ‘Conformity Assessment’

**Definition**: Process performed by third-party organizations such as testing companies (certification), inspectors etc., confirming whether requirements outlined in Chapter III Section 2 have been met by an entity placing products (including software) onto markets within Europe. This includes testing beyond just conformity checks conducted during initial development phases prior to placement on markets. It involves evaluating performance outcomes once deployed into real-world settings while considering factors like environmental conditions impacting performance accuracy. Additionally it encompasses conducting evaluations before deploying new versions based upon changes made since previous iterations were released so as ensure ongoing adherence towards original design goals despite evolving technological advancements over time. Such evaluations must consider both internal quality assurance processes as well as external validation mechanisms tailored specifically toward validating performance outcomes achieved via implementation thereof within real-world contexts rather than solely focused merely upon testing completed within controlled laboratory environments devoid altogether any reference whatsoever
