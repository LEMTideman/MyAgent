1. For high-risk AI systems listed in point 1 of [Annex III](https://ai-act-law.eu/annex/3/), where, in demonstrating the compliance of a high-risk AI system with the requirements set out in [Section 2](https://ai-act-law.eu/chapter/3/), the provider has applied harmonised standards referred to in [Article 40](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/40/), or, where applicable, common specifications referred to in [Article 41](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/41/), the provider shall opt for one of the following conformity assessment procedures based on:

    1. the internal control referred to in [Annex VI](https://ai-act-law.eu/annex/6/); or
    2. the assessment of the quality management system and the assessment of the technical documentation, with the involvement of a notified body, referred to in [Annex VII](https://ai-act-law.eu/annex/7/) .

    In demonstrating the compliance of a high-risk AI system with the requirements set out in [Section 2](https://ai-act-law.eu/chapter/3/), the provider shall follow the conformity assessment procedure set out in [Annex VII](https://ai-act-law.eu/annex/7/) where:

    1. harmonised standards referred to in [Article 40](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/40/) do not exist, and common specifications referred to in [Article 41](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/41/) are not available;
    2. the provider has not applied, or has applied only part of, the harmonised standard;
    3. the common specifications referred to in point (a) exist, but the provider has not applied them;
    4. one or more of the harmonised standards referred to in point (a) has been published with a restriction, and only on the part of the standard that was restricted.

    > **Note:** For the purposes of the conformity assessment procedure referred to in [Annex VII](https://ai-act-law.eu/annex/7/), the provider may choose any of the notified bodies.
> > However, where the high-risk AI system is intended to be put into service by law enforcement, immigration or asylum authorities or by Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, the market surveillance authority referred to in [Article 74(8)](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/74/) or (9), as applicable, shall act as a notified body.

2. For high-risk AI systems referred to in points 2 to 8 of [Annex III](https://ai-act-law.eu/annex/3/), providers shall follow the conformity assessment procedure based on internal control as referred to in [Annex VI](https://ai-act-law.eu/annex/6/), which does not provide for the involvement of a notified body.

    > **Note:** For high-risk AI systems covered by the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Section A of [Annex I](https://ai-act-law.eu/annex/I.html#_Toc595659865), the provider shall follow the relevant conformity assessment procedure as required under those legal acts.
    > The requirements set out in Section 2 of this Chapter shall apply to those high-risk AI systems and shall be part of that assessment.
    > Points 4.3., 4.4., 4.5. and the fifth paragraph of point (4.)'s "6." section shall also apply.
    
    For the purposes of that assessment, notified bodies which have been notified under those legal acts shall be entitled to control the conformity of these high-risk AI systems with the requirements set out in Section 2, provided that compliance with requirements laid down in Article 31(4), (5), (10) and (11) has been assessed within their notification process under those legal acts.
    
    Where a legal act listed in Section A of [Annex I](https://ai-act-law.eu/annex/I.html#_Toc595659865) enables product manufacturers to opt out from a third-party conformity assessment, provided that that manufacturer has applied all harmonised standards covering all relevant requirements, then that manufacturer may use that option only if it has also applied harmonised standards or, where applicable, common specifications referred to in [Article IV(VII).](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/VII/#_Toc595659866)

3. High-risk AI systems that have already been subject to a conformity assessment procedure shall undergo a new conformity assessment procedure in case of a substantial modification regardless whether modified system is intended for distribution or continues to be used by current deployer.

    For high-risk AI systems that continue learning after being placed on market or put into service changes pre-determined by provider at moment when initial conformity assessment took place and are part information contained within technical documentation referable under point (f) paragraph number four ("of") Annex IV , they shall not constitute substantial modification.

4. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts pursuant to Article 97 so as either amend Annexes VI and VII by updating them based on technical progress.

5. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts pursuant to Article 97 so as either amend paragraphs numbered one and two under this Article so as subject high-risk AI systems covered by points numbered two through eight under Annex III to conformity assessment procedure referable under Annex VII or parts thereof.

    The Commission shall adopt such delegated acts taking into account both effectiveness and availability for adequate capacities and resources among notified bodies.
