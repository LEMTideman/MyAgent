  "text": "```markdown\n# Recital 107\n\nIn order to increase transparency on the data that is used in the pre-training and training of general-purpose AI models, including text and data protected by copyright law, it is adequate that providers of such models draw up and make publicly available a sufficient summary of the content used for training the general-purpose AI model. While taking into due account the need to protect trade secrets and confidential business information, this summary should be generally comprehensive in its scope instead of technically detailed to facilitate parties with legitimate interests, including copyright holders, to exercise and enforce their rights under Union law, for example by listing the main data collections or sets that went into training the model, such as large private or public databases or data archives, and by providing a narrative explanation about other data sources used. It is appropriate for the AI Office to provide a template for the summary, which should be simple, effective, and allow the provider to provide the required summary in narrative form.\n\n## This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 13: Transparency and provision of information to deployers](/en/ai-act/article-13)\n*   [Article 53: Obligations for providers of general-purpose AI models](/en/ai-act/article-53)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).
