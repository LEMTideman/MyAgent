The effective implementation and enforcement of this Regulation require a governance framework that allows to coordinate and build up central expertise at Union level. The AI Office was established by Commission Decision(45) and has as its mission to develop Union expertise and capabilities in the field of AI and to contribute to the implementation of Union law on AI. Member States should facilitate the tasks of the AI Office with a view to support the development of Union expertise and capabilities at Union level and to strengthen the functioning of the digital single market. Furthermore, a Board composed of representatives of the Member States, a scientific panel to integrate the scientific community, and an advisory forum to contribute stakeholder input to the implementation of this Regulation, at Union and national level, should be established. The development of Union expertise and capabilities should also include making use of existing resources and expertise, in particular through synergies with structures built up in the context of the Union level enforcement of other law and synergies with related initiatives at Union level, such as the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking and the AI testing and experimentation facilities under the Digital Europe Programme.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 64: AI Office](/en/ai-act/article-64)\n*   [Article 65: Establishment and structure of the European Artificial Intelligence Board](/en/ai-act/article-65)\n*   [Article 66: Tasks of the Board](/en/ai-act/article-66)\n*   [Article 67: Advisory forum](/en/ai-act/article-67)\n*   [Article 68: Scientific panel of independent experts](/en/ai-act/article-68)\n*   [Article 69: Access to the pool of experts by the Member States](/en/ai-act/article-69)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).
