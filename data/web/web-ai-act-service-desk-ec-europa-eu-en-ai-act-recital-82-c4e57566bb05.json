Therefore, prior to making their AI systems available in the Union, providers established in third countries should, by written mandate, appoint an authorised representative established in the Union. This authorised representative plays a pivotal role in ensuring the compliance of the high-risk AI systems placed on the market or put into service in the Union by those providers who are not established in the Union and in serving as their contact person established in the Union.\n\n### Related Articles\n\n- [Article 16: Obligations of providers of high-risk AI systems](/en/ai-act/article-16)\n- [Article 22: Authorised representatives of providers of high-risk AI systems](/en/ai-act/article-22)\n- [Article 54: Authorised representatives of providers of general-purpose AI models](/en/ai-act/article-54)\n\n## Recital Text\n\nTo enable enforcement of this Regulation and create a level playing field for operators, and, taking into account the different forms of making available of digital products, it is important to ensure that, under all circumstances, a person established in the Union can provide authorities with all the necessary information on the compliance of an AI system.
