# Recital 88

## Overview

Along the AI value chain, multiple parties often supply AI systems, tools, and services, but also components or processes that are incorporated by the provider into the AI system with various objectives, including model training, model retraining, model testing and evaluation, integration into software, or other aspects of model development. Those parties have an important role to play in the value chain towards the provider of the high-risk AI system into which their AI systems, tools, services, components, or processes are integrated, and should provide by written agreement this provider with the necessary information, capabilities, technical access, and other assistance based on the generally acknowledged state of the art, in order to enable the provider to fully comply with the obligations set out in this Regulation, without compromising their own intellectual property rights or trade secrets.
