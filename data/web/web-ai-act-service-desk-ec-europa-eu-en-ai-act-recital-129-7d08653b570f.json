For high-risk AI systems only provided digitally, a digital CE marking should be used. Member States should not create unjustified obstacles to the placing on the market or the putting into service of high-risk AI systems that comply with the requirements laid down in this Regulation and bear the CE marking.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 48: CE marking](/en/ai-act/article-48)\n\n---\n\n## Contact Us\n\n*   [Contact the AI Office](mailto:CNECT-AIOFFICE@ec.europa.eu)\n```\n\n(Note: The refined markdown focuses strictly on the core content related to \"Recital 129\", excluding navigation elements, headers, footers, sidebars, etc.)\n```",
