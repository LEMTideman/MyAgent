- supporting sharing of best practices through cooperation with authorities involved in AI regulatory sandbox;
- fostering innovation and competitiveness facilitating development of an AI ecosystem;
- contributing to evidence-based regulatory learning;
- facilitating accelerated access to Union market for AI systems, particularly when provided by SMEs including start-ups.

National competent authorities shall ensure that, to the extent innovative AI systems involve processing personal data or otherwise fall under supervisory remit of other national authorities or competent authorities providing or supporting access to data—the national data protection authorities and those other national or competent authorities—are associated with operations of an AI regulatory sandbox—and involved in supervision of those aspects—up to their respective tasks and powers.

1. The AI regulatory sandboxes shall not affect supervisory or corrective powers of competent authorities overseeing these sandboxes—including at regional or local levels.
