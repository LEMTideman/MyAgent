## Another Area in Which the Use of AI Systems Deserves Special Consideration

The use of AI systems in accessing and enjoying essential private and public services and benefits necessary for people to fully participate in society or to improve their standard of living requires special attention. Natural persons applying for or receiving essential public assistance benefits and services from public authorities, such as healthcare services, social security benefits, social services providing protection in cases like maternity, illness, industrial accidents, dependency, or old age and loss of employment, are typically dependent on these benefits and services and face vulnerabilities related to the responsible authorities. If AI systems are used for determining whether such benefits and services should be granted, denied, reduced, revoked, or reclaimed by authorities, including whether beneficiaries are rightfully entitled to them, these systems may have a significant impact on individuals' livelihoods and could infringe their fundamental rights such as the right to social protection, non-discrimination, human dignity, or an effective remedy. This Regulation should not hinder the development and use of innovative approaches in the public administration unless they do not pose a high risk to legal and natural persons. Additionally, AI systems intended for evaluating credit scores or creditworthiness of natural persons should also be classified as high-risk AI systems due to potential negative impacts on individuals' livelihoods and health. These include discrimination against persons or groups and perpetuation of historical patterns of discrimination based on factors such as racial or ethnic origins, gender, disabilities, age, or sexual orientation. While some AI systems used for risk assessment and pricing in relation to natural persons for health and life insurance may not be considered high-risk under this Regulation but still have a significant impact on individuals' livelihoods and health resulting in serious consequences for their lives and health.
