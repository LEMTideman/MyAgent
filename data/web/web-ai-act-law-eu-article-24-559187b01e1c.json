Distributors shall ensure that, while a high-risk AI system is under their responsibility, storage or transport conditions, where applicable, do not jeopardise the compliance of the system with the requirements set out in [Section 2](https://ai-act-law.eu/chapter/3/).\n5. A distributor that considers or has reason to consider, on the basis of the information in its possession, a high-risk AI system which it has made available on the market not to be in conformity with the requirements set out in [Section 2](https://ai-act-law.eu/chapter/3/), shall take the corrective actions necessary to bring that system into conformity with those requirements, to withdraw it or recall it, or shall ensure that the provider, the importer or any relevant operator, as appropriate, takes those corrective actions.\n6. Where the high-risk AI system presents a risk within the meaning of [Article 79(1)](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/79/), the distributor shall immediately inform the provider or importer of the system and notify them via email if possible about any corrective actions taken.\n7.
