These specifications will be developed in consultation with the advisory forum and adopted through an examination procedure set out in [Article 98 (2)](/en/ai-act/article-98). AI systems conforming to these specifications will be presumed compliant with Section 2 of Chapter 3 (Requirements for high-risk AI systems) or, where applicable, certain obligations of Chapter 5. If harmonized standards are later adopted, the Commission will repeal the relevant implementing acts. Providers not complying with the common specifications must justify their alternative technical solutions. \n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n## Conditions for Adopting Implementing Acts\n\n1. The Commission may adopt, implementing acts establishing common specifications for the requirements set out in Section 2 of this Chapter or, as applicable, for the obligations set out in Sections 2 and 3 of Chapter V where:\n   - The Commission has requested, pursuant to [Article 10(1)](/en/ai-act/article-10) of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, one or more European standardization organizations to draft a harmonized standard for the requirements set out in Section 2 of this Chapter, or, as applicable, for the obligations set out in Sections 2 and 3 of Chapter V, and:\n     - The request has not been accepted by any of the European standardization organizations; or\n     - The harmonized standards addressing that request are not delivered within the deadline set in accordance with [Article 10(1)](/en/ai-act/article-10) of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012; or\n     - The relevant harmonized standards insufficiently address fundamental rights concerns; or\n     - The harmonized standards do not comply with the request;\n   - No reference to harmonized standards covering the requirements referred to in Section 2 of this Chapter or, as applicable, the obligations referred to in Sections 2 and 3 of Chapter V has been published in the Official Journal of the European Union in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, and no such reference is expected to be published within a reasonable period.\n\nWhen drafting the common specifications, the Commission shall consult the advisory forum referred to in [Article 67](/en/ai-act/article-67).\n\nThe implementing acts referred to in paragraph (a) shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in [Article 98(2)](/en/ai-act/article-98).\n\n### Related Recitals\n\n* [Recital 121](/en/ai-act/recital-121)\n* [Recital 122](/en/ai-act/recital-122)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).
