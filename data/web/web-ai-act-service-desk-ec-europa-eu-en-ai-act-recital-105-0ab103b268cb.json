The development and training of such models require access to vast amounts of text, images, videos, and other data. Text and data mining techniques may be used extensively in this context for the retrieval and analysis of such content, which may be protected by copyright and related rights. Any use of copyrighted material requires authorization from the rightsholder unless applicable copyright exceptions and limitations apply. Directive (EU) 2019/790 introduced exceptions and limitations allowing reproductions and extractions of works or other subject matter for text and data mining under certain conditions. These rules allow rightsholders to reserve their rights over their works or other subject matter against being authorized for text and data mining purposes that fall within the scope of these exceptions.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 53: Obligations for providers of general-purpose AI models](/en/ai-act/article-53)\n\n---\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).
