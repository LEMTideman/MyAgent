# Article 15: Accuracy, robustness and cybersecurity

## Chapter III: High-Risk AI Systems

### Section 2: Requirements for High-Risk AI Systems

#### Summary
High-risk AI systems must be designed to achieve an appropriate level of accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity throughout their lifecycle. The levels of accuracy and the relevant accuracy metrics of high-risk AI systems shall be declared in the accompanying instructions of use. High-risk AI systems should be resilient to errors, inconsistencies and faults. Cybersecurity should be ensured, with measures to prevent cyber-attacks, including data and model poisoning, adversarial examples, and confidentiality breaches. Technical solutions should be tailored to the system's risks and context.

The summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.
