# Article 22: Authorised Representatives of Providers of High-Risk AI Systems

## Chapter III: High-Risk AI Systems

### Section 3: Obligations of Providers and Deployers of High-Risk AI Systems and Other Parties

#### Summary
Providers of high-risk AI systems from outside the EU must appoint an authorised representative within the EU before releasing their systems on the market. This representative will verify compliance documentation, keep records for 10 years, and cooperate with authorities on requests and risk mitigation. The representative can also handle registration obligations and will terminate the mandate if the provider fails to comply with the AI Act, informing relevant authorities immediately.

The summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.

1. Prior to making their high-risk AI systems available on the Union market, providers established in third countries shall, by written mandate, appoint an authorised representative which is established in the Union.
2. The provider shall enable its authorised representative to perform the tasks specified in the mandate received from the provider.
3. The authorised representative shall perform the tasks specified in the mandate received from the provider. It shall provide a copy of the mandate to the market surveillance authorities upon request, in one of the official languages of the institutions of the Union, as indicated by the competent authority. For the purposes of this Regulation, the mandate shall empower the authorised representative to carry out the following tasks:
   - Verify that the EU declaration of conformity referred to in [Article 47](/en/ai-act/article-47) and the technical documentation referred to in [Article 11](/en/ai-act/article-11) have been drawn up and that an appropriate conformity assessment procedure has been carried out by the provider;
   - Keep at the disposal of the competent authorities and national authorities or bodies referred to in [Article 74(10)](/en/ai-act/article-74), for a period of 10 years after the high-risk AI system has been placed on the market or put into service, the contact details of the provider that appointed the authorised representative, a copy of the EU declaration of conformity referred to in [Article 47](/en/ai-act/article-47), the technical documentation and, if applicable, the certificate issued by the notified body;
   - Provide a competent authority, upon a reasoned request, with all the information and documentation, including that referred to in point (b) of this subparagraph, necessary to demonstrate the conformity of a high-risk AI system with the requirements set out in Section 2, including access to logs, as referred to in [Article 12(1)](/en/ai-act/article-12), automatically generated by the high-risk AI system, to the extent such logs are under the control of the provider;
   - Cooperate with competent authorities, upon a reasoned request, in any action taken by either a competent authority or another party mentioned above regarding a high-risk AI system;
   - Where applicable, comply with registration obligations referred to in [Article 49(1)](/en/ai-act/article-49), or ensure that information provided through point (e) is correct.
   
The mandate shall empower:
- To be addressed by competent authorities on all issues related to ensuring compliance with this Regulation.
- To terminate a mandate if it considers or has reason to consider that a provider is acting contrary to its obligations pursuant to this Regulation.
   
In such cases:
- The authorised representative should immediately inform relevant markets' surveillance authorities about these decisions.
