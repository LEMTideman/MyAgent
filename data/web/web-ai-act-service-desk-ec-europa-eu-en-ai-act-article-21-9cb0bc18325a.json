They must also grant access to the system's automatically generated logs if requested. Any information obtained by the authority will be treated confidentially.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n1. Providers of high-risk AI systems shall, upon a reasoned request by a competent authority, provide that authority all the information and documentation necessary to demonstrate the conformity of the high-risk AI system with the requirements set out in Section 2, in a language which can be easily understood by the authority in one of the official languages of the institutions of the Union as indicated by the Member State concerned.\n\n2. Upon a reasoned request by a competent authority, providers shall also give the requesting competent authority, as applicable, access to the automatically generated logs of the high-risk AI system referred to in [Article 12(1)](/en/ai-act/article-12), to the extent such logs are under their control.\n\n3.
