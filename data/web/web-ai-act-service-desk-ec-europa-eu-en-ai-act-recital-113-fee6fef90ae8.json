  "text": "```markdown\n# Recital 113\n\nIf the Commission becomes aware of the fact that a general-purpose AI model meets the requirements to classify as a general-purpose AI model with systemic risk, which previously had either not been known or of which the relevant provider has failed to notify the Commission, the Commission should be empowered to designate it so. A system of qualified alerts should ensure that the AI Office is made aware by the scientific panel of general-purpose AI models that should possibly be classified as general-purpose AI models with systemic risk, in addition to the monitoring activities of the AI Office.\n\n## This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 51: Classification of general-purpose AI models as general-purpose AI models with systemic risk](/en/ai-act/article-51)\n*   [Article 52: Procedure](/en/ai-act/article-52)\n*   [Article 90: Alerts of systemic risks by the scientific panel](/en/ai-act/article-90)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).
