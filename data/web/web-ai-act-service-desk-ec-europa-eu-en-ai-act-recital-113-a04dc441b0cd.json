A system of qualified alerts should ensure that the AI Office is made aware by the scientific panel of general-purpose AI models that should possibly be classified as general-purpose AI models with systemic risk, in addition to the monitoring activities of the AI Office.\n\n## This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 51: Classification of general-purpose AI models as general-purpose AI models with systemic risk](/en/ai-act/article-51)\n*   [Article 52: Procedure](/en/ai-act/article-52)\n*   [Article 90: Alerts of systemic risks by the scientific panel](/en/ai-act/article-90)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).
