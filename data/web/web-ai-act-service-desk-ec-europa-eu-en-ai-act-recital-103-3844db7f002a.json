These components can be provided through various channels, such as development on open repositories. However, the fact of making AI components available for a price or monetization does not automatically qualify them for the exceptions provided to free and open-source AI components. Only transactions between microenterprises should benefit from these exemptions.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 53: Obligations for providers of general-purpose AI models](/en/ai-act/article-53)\n\n---\n\n## Recital Text\n\nFree and open-source AI components cover the software and data, including models and general-purpose AI models, tools, services or processes of an AI system. Free and open-source AI components can be provided through different channels, including their development on open repositories. For the purposes of this Regulation, AI components that are provided against a price or otherwise monetized, including through the provision of technical support or other services related to the AI component or the use of personal data for reasons other than exclusively for improving the security, compatibility or interoperability of the software, with the exception of transactions between microenterprises, should not benefit from the exceptions provided to free and open-source AI components. The fact of making AI components available through open repositories should not, in itself, constitute a monetization.\n```",
