Art. 80 AI Act - Procedure for dealing with AI systems classified by the provider as non-high-risk in application of Annex III
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Where a market surveillance authority has sufficient reason to consider that an AI system classified by the provider as non-high-risk pursuant to [Article 6(3)](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/6/) is indeed high-risk, the market surveillance authority shall carry out an evaluation of the AI system concerned in respect of its classification as a high-risk AI system based on the conditions set out in [Article 6(3)](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/6/) and the Commission guidelines.
2. Where, in the course of that evaluation, the market surveillance authority finds that the AI system concerned is high-risk, it shall without undue delay require the relevant provider to take all necessary actions to bring the AI system into compliance with the requirements and obligations laid down in this Regulation, as well as take appropriate corrective action within a period the market surveillance authority may prescribe.
3. Where the market surveillance authority considers that the use of the AI system concerned is not restricted to its national territory, it shall inform the Commission and the other Member States without undue delay of the results of the evaluation and of the actions which it has required the provider to take.
4. The provider shall ensure that all necessary action is taken to bring the AI system into compliance with the requirements and obligations laid down in this Regulation. The second sentence applies if there are grounds for believing that such action will prevent contraventions under Articles 79(5), (6), (7) or (9).
5. If, during an inspection carried out pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article, it becomes apparent that an artificial intelligence system was misclassified by its owner as being low risk so as to avoid complying with these requirements because they were intended only to apply when applied abroad, then it shall be liable for any penalties provided for therein.
6. In exercising their powers according to Chapter IV, Section 2, Market Surveillance Authorities must also exercise their powers according to Article 110 of Regulation (EU) No 2020/1828 regarding safeguard procedures.
