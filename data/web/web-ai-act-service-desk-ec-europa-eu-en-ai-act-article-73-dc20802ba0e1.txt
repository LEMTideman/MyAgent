## Article 73: Reporting of serious incidents

### Section 2: Sharing of Information on Serious Incidents

#### Paragraph 1
Providers of high-risk AI systems placed on the Union market shall report any serious incident to the market surveillance authorities of the Member States where that incident occurred.

#### Paragraph 2
The report referred to in paragraph 1 shall be made immediately after the provider has established a causal link between the AI system and the serious incident or the reasonable likelihood of such a link, and, in any event, not later than 15 days after the provider or, where applicable, the deployer becomes aware of the serious incident. The period for the reporting referred to in paragraph 1 shall take account of the severity of the serious incident.

**Note:** The period for reporting should take into consideration both widespread infringements and deaths. If there is reason to suspect a causal relationship between an AI system and a serious incident before becoming aware of it, reports should be made within two business days.

#### Paragraph 3
In cases where there is a widespread infringement or a serious incident as defined in [Article 3](/en/ai-act/article-3), point (49)(b), providers must report their findings immediately upon becoming aware of these events. This applies even if there was no direct connection at that time.

#### Paragraph 4
If someone dies due to an AI system failure, reports must be made immediately once it can be confirmed that there is a causal link between this failure and death. These reports should be made within ten business days from when it became known that this happened.

#### Paragraph 5
When necessary to ensure timely reporting, providers may submit an initial report that is incomplete and then complete it further.

#### Paragraph 6
After reporting a serious incident pursuant to paragraph 1, providers must investigate promptly and assess potential risks. They must cooperate with competent authorities while conducting investigations and risk assessments without altering affected systems until informed about changes.

#### Paragraph 7
Market surveillance authorities must respond within seven working days following receipt of notifications related to reported severe incidents. They also need to notify relevant entities like notified bodies according to Regulation (EU) No. 2019/1020 regarding these notifications.
