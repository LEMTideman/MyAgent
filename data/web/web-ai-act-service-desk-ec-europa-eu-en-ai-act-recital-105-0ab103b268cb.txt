# Recital 105

## General-purpose AI Models, Copyright Protection, and Data Mining

General-purpose AI models, particularly large generative AI models capable of generating text, images, and other content, present unique innovation opportunities but also challenges to artists, authors, and other creators and the way their creative content is created, distributed, used, and consumed. The development and training of such models require access to vast amounts of text, images, videos, and other data. Text and data mining techniques may be used extensively in this context for the retrieval and analysis of such content, which may be protected by copyright and related rights. Any use of copyrighted material requires authorization from the rightsholder unless applicable copyright exceptions and limitations apply. Directive (EU) 2019/790 introduced exceptions and limitations allowing reproductions and extractions of works or other subject matter for text and data mining under certain conditions. These rules allow rightsholders to reserve their rights over their works or other subject matter against being authorized for text and data mining purposes that fall within the scope of these exceptions.
