This requires keeping records and the availability of technical documentation, containing information which is necessary to assess the compliance of the AI system with the relevant requirements and facilitate post market monitoring. Such information should include the general characteristics, capabilities and limitations of the system, algorithms, data, training, testing and validation processes used as well as documentation on the relevant risk-management system and drawn in a clear and comprehensive form. The technical documentation should be kept up to date, appropriately throughout the lifetime of the AI system. Furthermore, high-risk AI systems should technically allow for the automatic recording of events, by means of logs, over the duration of the lifetime of the system.\n\n### Related Articles\n\n- [Article 9: Risk management system](/en/ai-act/article-9)\n- [Article 11: Technical documentation](/en/ai-act/article-11)\n- [Article 12: Record-keeping](/en/ai-act/article-12)\n- [Article 13: Transparency and provision of information to deployers](/en/ai-act/article-13)\n- [Article 19: Automatically generated logs](/en/ai-act/article-19)\n- [Article 72: Post-market monitoring by providers and post-market monitoring plan for high-risk AI systems](/en/ai-act/article-72)\n\n## Contact Us\n\n**AI Act Service Desk**\n\nThis site is managed by:\nDirectorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology\n\n*   [Accessibility](/en/accessibility-statement)\n\n**Contact us**\n*   [Contact the AI Office](mailto:CNECT-AIOFFICE@ec.europa.eu)\n\n**About us**\n*   [Copyright notice](/en/copyright-notice)\n*   [Legal notice](/en/legal-notice)\n*   [Privacy statement](/en/privacy-statement-ai-act-service-desk-website)\n*   [About Directorate-General CONNECT](https://commission.europa.eu/about/departments-and-executive-agencies/communications-networks-content-and-technology_en)\n\n[![European Commission Logo](https://webtools.europa.eu/images/logos/logo.png)](https://commission.europa.eu/index_en)\n\n*   [Contact the European Commission](https://commission.europa.eu/contact-eu/social-media-channels_en#/search?page=0&institutions=european_commission)\n*   Follow the European Commission on social media\n    *   [](https://twitter.com/EU_Communications \"Twitter\")\n    *   [](https://www.facebook.com/europeancommservices \"Facebook\")\n    *   [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/european-commission/)\n    *   [](https://www.youtube.com/user/eucommunicationsservices \"YouTube\")\n\n*   Languages on our websites\n    *   [](https://commission.europa.eu/languages-on-others-websites_en \"Other languages on our websites\")\n*   Cookies\n    *   [](https://commission.europa.eu/cookies_en \"Cookie Policy\")\n*   Privacy policy\n    *   [](https://commission.europa.eu/privacy-policy_en \"Privacy Policy\")\n*   Legal notice\n    *   [](https://commission.europa.eu/legal-notices-vulnerability-disclosure-policy_en \"Vulnerability Disclosure Policy\")\n\n[![European Commission Logo Negative](https://webtools.europa.eu/images/logos/negative/logo.png)](https://commission.europa.eu/index_en)\n```",
