A general-purpose AI model that meets the applicable threshold for high-impact capabilities should be presumed to be a general-purpose AI models with systemic risk. The provider should notify the AI Office at the latest two weeks after the requirements are met or it becomes known that a general-purpose AI model will meet the requirements that lead to the presumption. This is especially relevant in relation to the threshold of floating point operations because training of general-purpose AI models takes considerable planning which includes the upfront allocation of compute resources and, therefore, providers of general-purpose AI models are able to know if their model would meet the threshold before the training is completed. In the context of that notification, the provider should be able to demonstrate that, because of its specific characteristics, a general-purpose AI model exceptionally does not present systemic risks, and that it thus should not be classified as a general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. That information is valuable for the AI Office to anticipate the placing on the market of general-purpose AI models with systemic risks and the providers can start to engage with the AI Office early on. That information is especially important with regard to general-purpose AI models that are planned to be released as open-source, given that, after the open-source model release, necessary measures to ensure compliance with the obligations under this Regulation may be more difficult to implement.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 52: Procedure](/en/ai-act/article-52)\n\n---\n\n## Contact Us\n\n*   [Contact the AI Office](mailto:CNECT-AIOFFICE@ec.europa.eu)\n\n## About Us\n\n*   [Copyright notice](/en/copyright-notice)\n*   [Legal notice](/en/legal-notice)\n*   [Privacy statement](/en/privacy-statement-ai-act-service-desk-website)\n*   [About Directorate-General CONNECT](https://commission.europa.eu/about-departments-and-executive-agencies/communications-networks-content-and-technology_en)\n\n[![European Commission Logo](https://webtools.europa.eu/images/flags/eu.svg)](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en \"European Commission\")\n\n[AI Act Service Desk](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en)\n\nThis site is managed by:\nDirectorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology\n\n*   [Accessibility](/en/accessibility-statement)\n\n## Social Media Links\n\n*   [Contact Director-General CONNECT via Email](mailto:CNECT-AIOFFICE@ec.europa.eu)\n*   Follow European Commission on social media\n    *   [](https://twitter.com/EU_connect)\n    *   [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/european-commission/)\n    *   [](https://www.youtube.com/user/MediaDCOMCONNECT)\n    *   [](https://www.flickr.com/photos/commsdcomconnect/)\n    *   [](https://www.instagram.com/europeancommunicationsnetworkscontentandtechnology/)\n    *   [](https://www.facebook.com/EUConnectOfficialPage/)\n    *   [](https://www.tiktok.com/@eucnect?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&sender_channel=from_webapp)\n\n## Legal Information\n\n*   [Contact European Commission](https://commission.europa.eu/contact-eu/social-media-channels_en#/search?page=0&institutions=european_commission)\n*   Report an IT vulnerability\n    *   [](https://commission.europa.eu/resources-partners_en)\n*   Languages on our websites\n    *   [](https://commission.europa.eu/languages-our-websites_en)\n*   Cookies\n    *   [](https://commission.europa.eu/cookies_en)\n*   Privacy policy\n    *   [](https://commission.europa.eu/privacy-policy_en)\n*   Legal notice\n    *   [](https://commission.europa.eu/legal-notice_en)\n\n[![European Commission Logo Negative](https://webtools.europa.eu/images/flags/negative/logo-ec--en.svg)](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en \"European Commission\")\n```",
