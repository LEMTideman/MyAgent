They should be resilient in relation to harmful or otherwise undesirable behavior that may result from limitations within the systems or the environment in which the systems operate (e.g., errors, faults, inconsistencies, unexpected situations). Therefore, technical and organizational measures should be taken to ensure robustness of high-risk AI systems, for example by designing and developing appropriate technical solutions to prevent or minimize harmful or otherwise undesirable behavior. Those technical solutions may include, for instance, mechanisms enabling the system to safely interrupt its operation (fail-safe plans) in the presence of certain anomalies or when operation takes place outside certain predetermined boundaries. Failure to protect against these risks could lead to safety impacts or negatively affect fundamental rights, such as due to erroneous decisions or wrong or biased outputs generated by the AI system.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 15: Accuracy, robustness and cybersecurity](/en/ai-act/article-15)\n\n---\n\n## Contact Us\n\n*   [Contact the AI Office](mailto:CNECT-AIOFFICE@ec.europa.eu)\n\n## About Us\n\n*   [Copyright notice](/en/copyright-notice)\n*   [Legal notice](/en/legal-notice)\n*   [Privacy statement](/en/privacy-statement-ai-act-service-desk-website)\n*   [About Directorate-General CONNECT](https://commission.europa.eu/about-departments-and-executive-agencies/communications-networks-content-and-technology_en)\n\n[![European Commission Logo](https://webtools.europa.eu/images/flags/eu.svg)](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en \"European Commission\")\n\n**AI Act Service Desk**\n\nThis site is managed by:\nDirectorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology\n\n*   [Accessibility](/en/accessibility-statement)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).
