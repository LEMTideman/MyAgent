In those guidelines, the AI HLEG developed seven non-binding ethical principles for AI which are intended to help ensure that AI is trustworthy and ethically sound. The seven principles include human agency and oversight; technical robustness and safety; privacy and data governance; transparency; diversity, non-discrimination and fairness; societal and environmental well-being and accountability. Without prejudice to the legally binding requirements of this Regulation and any other applicable Union law, those guidelines contribute to the design of coherent, trustworthy and human-centric AI, in line with the Charter and with the values on which the Union is founded. According to the guidelines of the AI HLEG, human agency and oversight means that AI systems are developed and used as a tool that serves people, respects human dignity and personal autonomy, and that is functioning in a way that can be appropriately controlled and overseen by humans. Technical robustness and safety means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that allows robustness in the case of problems and resilience against attempts to alter the use or performance of the AI system so as to allow unlawful use by third parties, and minimise unintended harm. Privacy and data governance means that AI systems are developed and used in accordance with privacy and data protection rules, while processing data that meets high standards in terms of quality and integrity. Transparency means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that allows appropriate traceability and explainability, while making humans aware that they communicate or interact with an AI system, as well as duly informing deployers of the capabilities and limitations of that AI system and affected persons about their rights. Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that includes diverse actors and promotes equal access, gender equality和文化多样性，同时避免歧视性影响和不公平偏见等禁止的法律行为。社会和环境福祉意味着AI系统在可持续且环保的基础上，并且有利于所有人类个体、社会以及民主，同时监测评估长期对个人、社会及民主的影响。\n\nThe application of these principles should be translated where possible into designing, using, developing, training or operating artificial intelligence models. These principles should also serve as a basis for drafting voluntary best practices under this Regulation.\n\n### This Recital relates to:\n\n*   [Article 13: Transparency](/en/ai-act/article-13)\n*   [Article 14: Human Oversight](/en/ai-act/article-14)\n*   [Article 15: Accuracy Robustness Cybersecurity](/en/ai-act/article-15)\n\n---\n\n## Recital Text\n\nWhile the risk-based approach is the basis for a proportionate and effective set of binding rules, it is important to recall the 2019 Ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI developed by the independent AI HLEG appointed by the Commission.
