They must operate with professional integrity, competence, and sufficient internal expertise, participating in coordination activities and staying updated on relevant standards.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n### Relevant Recitals\n\n*   [Recital 68](/en/ai-act/recital-68)\n*   [Recital 125](/en/ai-act/recital-125)\n*   [Recital 126](/en/ai-act/recital-126)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).

Notified bodies shall also be independent of any other operator having an economic interest in high-risk AI systems assessed, as well as of any competitors of the provider. This shall not preclude the use of assessed high-risk AI systems that are necessary for the operations of the conformity assessment body, or the use of such high-risk AI systems for personal purposes.\n\n### Independence from Economic Interests\n\n**Summary**\n\nNeither a conformity assessment body, its top-level management nor the personnel responsible for carrying out its conformity assessment tasks shall be directly involved in the design, development, marketing or use of high-risk AI systems, nor shall they represent the parties engaged in those activities. They shall not engage in any activity that might conflict with their independence of judgement or integrity in relation to conformity assessment activities for which they are notified. This shall, in particular, apply to consultancy services.\n\n### Independent Personnel\n\n**Summary**\n\nNotified bodies shall have documented procedures in place ensuring that their personnel maintain professional secrecy with regard to all information obtained in carrying out their tasks under this Regulation. Except when its disclosure is required by law.\n\nStaff of notified bodies shall be bound to observe professional secrecy with regard to all information obtained in carrying out their tasks under this Regulation.\n\n### Liability Insurance\n\n**Summary**\n\nNotified bodies shall take out appropriate liability insurance for their conformity assessment activities unless liability is assumed by the Member State in which they are established according to national law or that Member State is itself directly responsible for conducting these assessments.\n\n### Professional Integrity\n\n**Summary**\n\nNotified bodies shall be capable of carrying out all their tasks with highest professional integrity and requisite competence in the specific field whether those tasks are carried out by notified bodies themselves or on their behalf under their responsibility.\n\n### Internal Competence\n\n**Summary**\n\nNotified bodies shall have sufficient internal competences to effectively evaluate tasks conducted by external parties on their behalf. Their staff should possess experience and knowledge related to relevant types of AI systems data and data computing relating to requirements set out in Section 2.\n\n### Participation in Coordination Activities\n\n**Summary**\n\nNotified bodies shall participate in coordination activities as referred to in Article 38. They may also represent Europe within European standardisation organizations or stay informed about relevant standards.\n\n---\n\n## Related Links\n\n*   [Recital 68](/en/ai-act/recital-68)\n*   [Recital 125](/en/ai-act/recital-125)\n*   [Recital 126](/en/ai-act/recital-126)\n\nView official text: [Artificial Intelligence Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).\n```",
