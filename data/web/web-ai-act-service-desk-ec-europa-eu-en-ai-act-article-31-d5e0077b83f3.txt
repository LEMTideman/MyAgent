## Article 31: Requirements relating to notified bodies

### Organisational Structure

**Summary**

Notified bodies shall be legally established under the national law of a Member State and shall have legal personality.

They shall satisfy the organisational, quality management, resources and process requirements that are necessary to fulfil their tasks, as well as suitable cybersecurity requirements.

Their organisational structure, allocation of responsibilities, reporting lines and operation of notified bodies shall ensure confidence in their performance, and in the results of the conformity assessment activities that the notified bodies conduct.

### Independence from Provider

**Summary**

Notified bodies shall be independent of the provider of a high-risk AI system in relation to which they perform conformity assessment activities. Notified bodies shall also be independent of any other operator having an economic interest in high-risk AI systems assessed, as well as of any competitors of the provider. This shall not preclude the use of assessed high-risk AI systems that are necessary for the operations of the conformity assessment body, or the use of such high-risk AI systems for personal purposes.

### Independence from Economic Interests

**Summary**

Neither a conformity assessment body, its top-level management nor the personnel responsible for carrying out its conformity assessment tasks shall be directly involved in the design, development, marketing or use of high-risk AI systems, nor shall they represent the parties engaged in those activities. They shall not engage in any activity that might conflict with their independence of judgement or integrity in relation to conformity assessment activities for which they are notified. This shall, in particular, apply to consultancy services.

### Independent Personnel

**Summary**

Notified bodies shall have documented procedures in place ensuring that their personnel maintain professional secrecy with regard to all information obtained in carrying out their tasks under this Regulation. Except when its disclosure is required by law.

Staff of notified bodies shall be bound to observe professional secrecy with regard to all information obtained in carrying out their tasks under this Regulation.

### Liability Insurance

**Summary**

Notified bodies shall take out appropriate liability insurance for their conformity assessment activities unless liability is assumed by the Member State in which they are established according to national law or that Member State is itself directly responsible for conducting these assessments.

### Professional Integrity

**Summary**

Notified bodies shall be capable of carrying out all their tasks with highest professional integrity and requisite competence in the specific field whether those tasks are carried out by notified bodies themselves or on their behalf under their responsibility.

### Internal Competence

**Summary**

Notified bodies shall have sufficient internal competences to effectively evaluate tasks conducted by external parties on their behalf. Their staff should possess experience and knowledge related to relevant types of AI systems data and data computing relating to requirements set out in Section 2.

### Participation in Coordination Activities

**Summary**

Notified bodies shall participate in coordination activities as referred to in Article 38. They may also represent Europe within European standardisation organizations or stay informed about relevant standards.
