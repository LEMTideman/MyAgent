The notifying authority shall notify the Commission and the other Member States of any relevant changes to the notification of a notified body via the electronic notification tool referred to in [Article 30(2)](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/30/).\n   \n2. The procedures laid down in [Articles 29](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/29/) and [30](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/30/) shall apply to extensions of the scope of the notification.\n   \n   For changes to the notification other than extensions of its scope, the procedures laid down in paragraphs (3) to (9) shall apply.\n\n3. Where a notified body decides to cease its conformity assessment activities, it shall inform the notifying authority and the providers concerned as soon as possible and, in the case of a planned cessation, at least one year before ceasing its activities.  \n   The certificates of the notified body may remain valid for a period of nine months after cessation of the notified body’s activities, on condition that another notified body has confirmed in writing that it will assume responsibilities for the high-risk AI systems covered by those certificates.  \n   The latter notified body shall complete a full assessment of the high-risk AI systems affected by the end of that nine-month-period before issuing new certificates for those systems.  \n   Where the notified body has ceased its activity, the notifying authority shall withdraw the designation.\n\n4. Where a notifying authority has sufficient reason to consider that a notified body no longer meets the requirements laid down in [Article 31](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/31/), or that it is failing to fulfill its obligations, the notifying authority shall without delay investigate the matter with utmost diligence.\n   \n   In that context, it shall inform the notified body concerned about the objections raised and give it the possibility to make its views known.\n   \n   If the notifying authority comes to the conclusion that the notified body no longer meets these requirements or fails to fulfill these obligations, it shall restrict, suspend or withdraw its designation as appropriate, depending on the seriousness of this failure or obligation fulfillment.\n   \n   It shall immediately inform both entities mentioned above accordingly.\n\n5. Where its designation has been suspended, restricted, or fully or partially withdrawn, the notified body shall inform the providers concerned within 10 days.\n\n6. In cases where a designation has been suspended or restricted:\n   \n   - Assessing impacts on certified documents;\n   - Submitting reports regarding findings within three months;\n   - Requiring certified bodies to suspend or withdraw unduly-certified documents; and\n   - Informing both entities mentioned above about certifications affected by suspension/restriction;\n\n7. With a designation withdrawn:\n   \n   - Certificates remain valid for nine months under several circumstances:\n     \n      - No risk to health, safety, or fundamental rights associated with affected high-risk AI systems; and\n      - Another designated entity assumes immediate responsibility for these systems and completes an assessment within twelve months.\n      \n      Additional periods can be extended up to a maximum total duration of twelve months if requested by either entity involved.\n      \n      National competent authorities or designated bodies temporarily assumed under such circumstances must provide information as per regulations concerning places of business where providers operate.\n\n8. Other notes:\n   \n   - Certifications issued unduly may continue until they are revoked upon confirmation by both entities mentioned above within one month.\n   \n   - When suspending, restricting, or withdrawing a designation due to concerns over compliance with legal requirements or failures to fulfill contractual commitments, an interim validity extension may be granted for additional up to six months periods but not exceeding twelve months overall.\n    \n    National competent authorities should promptly advise both EU regulators and other designated bodies regarding affected certifications when restrictions/suspensions occur.\n\n---\n\n### Suitable Recitals\n\n- [(47)](https://ai-act-law.eu/recital/47/) Risk minimization in AI systems for health and safety\n- [(125)](https://ai-act-law.eu/recital/125/) Limited conformity assessment by third parties\n- [(126)](https://ai-act-law.eu/recital/126/) Procedure for third-party conformity assessments\n\n[Back To Table Of Contents](https://ai-act-law.eu)\n\n[Report Error](https://ai-act-law.eu/gf/?TB_iframe=true&height=315 \"Your message\")\n```",
