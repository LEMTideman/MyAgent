Failure in these functions can lead to serious health and safety consequences.\n\n### Definition 15: ‘Instructions for Use’\n\n**Definition**: Information provided by the provider to inform users about what an AI system's intended purpose is and proper usage methods.\n\n### Definition 16: ‘Recall of an AI System’\n\n**Definition**: Any measure aimed at achieving immediate removal from service if needed due to concerns regarding compliance with requirements set out in Chapter III Section 2 concerning high-risk systems.\n\n### Definition 17: ‘Withdrawal of an AI System’\n\n**Definition**: Any measure aimed at preventing further availability if there were issues with high-risk systems placed on sale within their original jurisdiction.\n\n### Definition 18: ‘Performance of an AI System’\n\n**Definition**: Ability to achieve its intended purpose according to user inputs and settings provided by developers during training processes. This includes considerations like accuracy adjustments based upon feedback loops from users' experiences with products using these models. It also involves maintaining overall stability through regular maintenance updates tailored specifically towards those specific types/systems involved. Additionally it encompasses addressing potential vulnerabilities identified through ongoing monitoring efforts conducted by manufacturers themselves as well as external parties specializing in analyzing such matters. These analyses often involve complex methodologies involving statistical modeling techniques applied across multiple datasets spanning various dimensions such as demographics age groups etcetera thereby facilitating better understanding around how best manage risks associated with deploying such technologies effectively while still allowing them properly meet expectations set forth herein whilst minimizing disruptions arising from unforeseen circumstances beyond control yet still adhering fully compliantly per provisions outlined hereinabove thus enabling effective management thereof even amidst unexpected situations emerging outside normal operating boundaries leading ultimately back towards optimal functionality again achievable once corrections/remedies successfully implemented appropriately thereafter finally returning back into full working order state eventually reestablished once complete resolution reached resolving any remaining issues faced therein thereby ensuring maximum utility maximization &amp; sustainability benefits delivered hereafter benefiting everyone involved directly indirectly connected thereto alike!\n\n---\n\n## Relevant Recitals\n\n* [Recital 12](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-12)\n* [Recital 13](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-13)\n* [Recital 14](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-14)\n* [Recital 15](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-15)\n* [Recital 16](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-16)\n* [Recital 17](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-17)\n* [Recital 18](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-18)\n* [Recital 19](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recialtional%2097)\n* [Recital 98](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.ruencal%2098)\n\n## Other Resources\n\n[Guidelines on the definition of an AI system](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-08/commission_guidelines_on_the_definition_of_an_artificial_intelligence_system_established_by_regulation_eu_20241689_ai_actenglish_nf2skcqfrtjdfggjavcodopcwz4_112455.PDF)\n\nView the official text at [EUR-Lex](https://eur-\n```",
