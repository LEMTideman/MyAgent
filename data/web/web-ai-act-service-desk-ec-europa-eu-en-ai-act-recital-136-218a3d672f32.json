  "text": "```markdown\n# Recital 136\n\nThe obligations placed on providers and deployers of certain AI systems in this Regulation to enable the detection and disclosure that the outputs of those systems are artificially generated or manipulated are particularly relevant to facilitate the effective implementation of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065. This applies in particular as regards the obligations of providers of very large online platforms or very large online search engines to identify and mitigate systemic risks that may arise from the dissemination of content that has been artificially generated or manipulated, in particular the risk of the actual or foreseeable negative effects on democratic processes, civic discourse and electoral processes, including through disinformation. The requirement to label content generated by AI systems under this Regulation is without prejudice to the obligation in [Article 16(6)](/en/ai-act/article-16) of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 for providers of hosting services to process notices on illegal content received pursuant to [Article 16(1)](/en/ai-act/article-16) of that Regulation and should not influence the assessment and the decision on the illegality of the specific content. That assessment should be performed solely with reference to the rules governing the legality of the content.\n\n## This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 16: Obligations of providers of high-risk AI systems](/en/ai-act/article-16)\n*   [Article 26: Obligations of deployers of high-risk AI systems](/en/ai-act/article-26)\n*   [Article 50: Transparency obligations for providers and deployers of certain AI systems](/en/ai-act/article-50)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).
