# Annex XI

## Section 1: Information to be provided by all providers of general-purpose AI models

The technical documentation referred to in [Article 53(1)](/en/ai-act/article-53), point (a) shall contain at least the following information as appropriate to the size and risk profile of the model:

### Point (a)
- A general description of the general-purpose AI model including:
  - the tasks that the model is intended to perform and the type and nature of AI systems in which it can be integrated;
  - the acceptable use policies applicable;
  - the date of release and methods of distribution;
  - the architecture and number of parameters;
  - the modality (e.g., text, image) and format of inputs and outputs;
  - the licence.

### Point (b)
- A detailed description of the elements of the model referred to in point 1, and relevant information of the process for the development, including:
  - the technical means (e.g., instructions of use, infrastructure, tools) required for the general-purpose AI model to be integrated in AI systems;
  - the design specifications of the model and training process, including training methodologies and techniques, the key design choices including the rationale and assumptions made; what the model is designed to optimise for and the relevance of the different parameters, as applicable;
  - information on the data used for training, testing, and validation, where applicable, including types and provenance of data and curative methodologies (e.g., cleaning, filtering);
  - computational resources used to train the model (e.g., number of floating-point operations), training time, and other relevant details related to training;
  - known or estimated energy consumption of the model.

With regard to point (e), where energy consumption is unknown:
- Energy consumption may be based on information about computational resources used.

### Point (c)
- Additional information regarding:
  - evaluation strategies, including evaluation results on available public evaluation protocols and tools or otherwise using other evaluation methodologies. Evaluation strategies should include evaluation criteria, metrics, and methodology for identifying limitations.
  - Where applicable:
    - detailed description of measures put in place for internal and/or external adversarial testing (red teaming).
    - Model adaptations including alignment and fine-tuning.
    - System architecture explaining how software components build or feed into each other and integrate into overall processing.

## Section 2: Additional information to be provided by providers of general-purpose AI models with systemic risk
