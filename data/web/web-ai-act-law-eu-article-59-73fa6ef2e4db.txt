1. In the AI regulatory sandbox, personal data lawfully collected for other purposes may be processed solely for the purpose of developing, training and testing certain AI systems in the sandbox when all of the following conditions are met:

    1. AI systems shall be developed for safeguarding substantial public interest by a public authority or another natural or legal person and in one or more of the following areas:
        1. public safety and public health, including disease detection, diagnosis prevention, control and treatment and improvement of health care systems;
        2. a high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment, protection of biodiversity, protection against pollution, green transition measures, climate change mitigation and adaptation measures;
        3. energy sustainability;
        4. safety and resilience of transport systems and mobility, critical infrastructure and networks;
        5. efficiency and quality of public administration and public services;

    2. the data processed are necessary for complying with one or more of the requirements referred to in [Chapter III](https://ai-act-law.eu/chapter/3/), Section 2 where those requirements cannot effectively be fulfilled by processing anonymised, synthetic or other non-personal data;
    3. there are effective monitoring mechanisms to identify if any high risks to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects, as referred to in [Article 35](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-35-gdpr/) of Regulation (EU) No 2016/679 and in [Article 39](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32018R1725#d1e2915-39-1) of Regulation (EU) No 2018/1725, may arise during the sandbox experimentation, as well as response mechanisms to promptly mitigate those risks and, where necessary, stop the processing;
    4. any personal data to be processed in the context of the sandbox are in a functionally separate, isolated and protected data processing environment under the control of the prospective provider and only authorised persons have access to those data;
    5. providers can further share the originally collected data only in accordance with Union data protection law; any personal data created in the sandbox cannot be shared outside the sandbox;
    6. any processing of personal data in the context of the sandbox neither leads to measures or decisions affecting the data subjects nor does it affect the application of their rights laid down in Union law on the protection of personal data;
    7. any personal data processed in the context of the sandbox are protected by means of appropriate technical and organisational measures and deleted once the participation in the sandbox has terminated or the personal data has reached the end of its retention period;
    8. the logs of the processing of personal data in the context of the sandbox are kept for the duration of the participation in the sandbox, unless provided otherwise by Union or national law;
    9. a complete and detailed description of the process and rationale behind the training, testing and validation of the AI system is kept together with the testing results as part of the technical documentation referred to in [Annex IV](https://ai-act-law.eu/annex/4/);
    10. a short summary of the AI project developed in the sandbox, its objectives and expected results is published on the website of the competent authorities; this obligation shall not cover sensitive operational data in relation to activities such as law enforcement, border control, immigration or asylum authorities.
