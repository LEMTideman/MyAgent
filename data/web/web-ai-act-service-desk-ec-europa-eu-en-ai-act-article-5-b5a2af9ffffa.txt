# Article 5: Prohibited AI practices

## Summary

[Article 5](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-5) prohibits the placing on the EU market, putting into service or use of certain AI systems for manipulative, exploitative and social scoring practices, which by their inherent nature violate fundamental rights and EU values. It also outlaws certain AI systems used for individual criminal offence risk assessment and prediction based solely on profiling or personality traits and characteristics, untargeted scraping to develop facial recognition databases, emotion recognition and biometric categorization. Real-time remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces for the purposes of law enforcement is also prohibited with some exceptions.

The summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.

### 1\. The following AI practices shall be prohibited:

(a) the placing on the market, the putting into service or the use of an AI system that deploys subliminal techniques beyond a person’s consciousness or purposely manipulative or deceptive techniques, with the objective, or the effect of materially distorting the behavior of a person or a group of persons by appreciably impairing their ability to make an informed decision, thereby causing them to take a decision that they would not have otherwise taken in a manner that causes or is reasonably likely to cause that person, another person or group of persons significant harm;

(b) the placing on the market, the putting into service or the use of an AI system that exploits any of the vulnerabilities of a natural person or a specific group of persons due to their age, disability or a specific social or economic situation, with the objective, or the effect, of materially distorting the behavior of that person or a person belonging to that group in a manner that causes or is reasonably likely to cause that person or another person significant harm;

(c) the placing on the market, the putting into service or the use of an AI system for evaluating or classifying natural persons or groups of persons over a certain period of time based on their social behavior or known, inferred or predicted personal or personality characteristics, with social scores leading to either:
   - detrimental or unfavorable treatment of certain natural persons or groups of persons in social contexts unrelated to those in which the data was originally generated or collected;
   - detrimental or unfavorable treatment of certain natural persons or groups of persons that is unjustified or disproportionate to their social behavior and its gravity;

(d) the placing on the market, putting into service for this specific purpose, or using an AI system for making risk assessments of natural persons in order to assess或predict risk levels associated with criminal offenses based solely on profiling individuals based on these profiles alone (which involves subjective interpretation rather than direct links between data generation and crime).

(e) placing on the market, putting into service for this specific purpose, using an AI system for making risk assessments based solely on profiling individuals based solely on these profiles alone (which involves subjective interpretation rather than direct links between data generation and crime);

(f) using 'real-time' remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes for any objective listed in paragraph 1(h). This includes targeting searches for missing people who have gone missing after being abducted, trafficked in humans, sexually exploited children etc., preventing terrorist attacks via location tracking technology (if authorized), localizing suspects suspected of committing crimes within police jurisdictions. These uses must be strictly necessary and proportionate.

#### Point (h) refers to:
- Targeted searches for missing people who have gone missing after being abducted,
- Prevention against terrorist acts through location tracking technology,
- Localizing suspects suspected of committing crimes within police jurisdictions.

(g) Using 'real-time' remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes for any objective listed in paragraph 1(h). This includes targeting searches for missing people who have gone missing after being abducted,
- Prevention against terrorist acts through location tracking technology,
- Localizing suspects suspected of committing crimes within police jurisdictions.

#### Note:
Point (h) applies only when it is necessary and proportionate to achieve one of paragraph 1's goals listed above.

### 2\. The use of 'real-time' remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes can be authorized only if:
(a) it is strictly necessary and proportionate;
(b) it meets necessary safeguards and conditions regarding temporal limits;
(c) it complies with mandatory restrictions regarding geographic scope;
(d) it ensures transparency about how data is processed;
(e) it provides adequate protection against privacy breaches.

### 3\. Each use requires prior authorization granted by a judicial authority. Authorization can be revoked if there are insufficient grounds.

### 4\. Notifications should be submitted annually by member states and national market surveillance authorities. Annual reports will be published by Commission.
