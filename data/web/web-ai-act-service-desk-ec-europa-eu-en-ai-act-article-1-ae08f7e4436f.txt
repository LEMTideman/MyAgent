## Summary

The AI Act aims to improve the functioning of the European market by creating uniform rules for AI systems and models. These common rules guide everyone who develops, provides or deploys AI systems and models, making it easier for businesses and entrepreneurs to know what is required and helping consumers trust AI products. It also promotes the development and use of AI that is safe and respects fundamental rights and EU values. Lastly, it encourages innovation, especially for SMEs and startups.

The summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.
