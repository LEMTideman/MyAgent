They must protect intellectual property, trade secrets, public security, and other sensitive information. Authorities can only request necessary data and must implement cybersecurity measures to protect it. Except as otherwise provided, information exchanged confidentially must not be disclosed without consultation, and certain data related to law enforcement must remain within specific authorities. The article also allows for the exchange of confidential information with third-country regulatory authorities under appropriate agreements.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n## Article 78: Confidentiality\n\n### Section 3: Enforcement\n\n#### 1.
