# Article 81: Union safeguard procedure

## Chapter IX: Post-Market Monitoring, Information Sharing and Market Surveillance
### Section 3: Enforcement

#### Summary
The Union safeguard procedure outlines steps to address objections raised by a Member State's market surveillance authority or the European Commission regarding measures taken against non-compliant AI systems. If objections arise within specified timeframes, the Commission consults with relevant authorities and operators to evaluate the national measure. If the measure is deemed justified, all Member States must take appropriate restrictive actions. If unjustified, the Member State must withdraw the measure. If the non-compliance is due to shortcomings in harmonised standards, the Commission will follow the procedure outlined in [Article 11](/en/ai-act/article-11) of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012.

The summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.
