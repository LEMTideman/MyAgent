# Recital 46

## Overview

High-risk AI systems should only be placed on the Union market, put into service or used if they comply with certain mandatory requirements. Those requirements should ensure that high-risk AI systems available in the Union or whose output is otherwise used in the Union do not pose unacceptable risks to important Union public interests as recognized and protected by Union law. On the basis of the New Legislative Framework, as clarified in the Commission notice ‘The “Blue Guide” on the implementation of EU product rules 2022’(20), the general rule is that more than one legal act of Union harmonization legislation, such as Regulations (EU) 2017/745(21) and (EU) 2017/746(22) of the European Parliament and of the Council or Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(23), may be applicable to one product, since the making available or putting into service can take place only when the product complies with all applicable Union harmonization legislation. To ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary administrative burdens or costs, providers of a product that contains one or more high-risk AI systems, to which the requirements of this Regulation and of the Union harmonization legislation listed in an annex to this Regulation apply, should have flexibility with regard to operational decisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains one or more AI systems with all applicable requirements of the Union harmonization legislation in an optimal manner. AI systems identified as high-risk should be limited to those that have a significant harmful impact on the health, safety and fundamental rights of persons in the Union and such limitation should minimize any potential restriction to international trade.
