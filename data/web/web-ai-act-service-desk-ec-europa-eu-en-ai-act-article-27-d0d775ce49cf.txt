# Article 27: Fundamental rights impact assessment for high-risk AI systems

## Summary

Before deploying certain high-risk AI systems, public bodies and specific private entities must perform an assessment of the impact on fundamental rights, describing the usage, affected groups, risks, human oversight, and mitigation measures. This assessment is required for the first use and must be updated if changes occur. Deployers must notify authorities of the results using a provided template, unless exempt. The assessment complements existing data protection impact assessments.

The summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.

1. Prior to deploying a high-risk AI system referred to in [Article 6(2)](/en/ai-act/article-6), with the exception of high-risk AI systems intended to be used in the area listed in point 2 of [Annex III](/en/ai-act/annex-3), deployers that are bodies governed by public law, or are private entities providing public services, and deployers of high-risk AI systems referred to in points 5 (b) and (c) of [Annex III](/en/ai-act/annex-3), shall perform an assessment of the impact on fundamental rights that the use of such system may produce. For that purpose, deployers shall perform an assessment consisting of:

   - a description of the deployer’s processes in which the high-risk AI system will be used in line with its intended purpose;
   - a description of the period of time within which, and the frequency with which, each high-risk AI system is intended to be used;
   - the categories of natural persons and groups likely to be affected by its use in the specific context;
   - the specific risks of harm likely to have an impact on the categories of natural persons or groups of persons identified pursuant to point (c) of this paragraph, taking into account the information given by the provider pursuant to [Article 13](/en/ai-act/article-13);
   - a description of the implementation of human oversight measures, according to the instructions for use;
   - the measures to be taken in the case of the materialisation of those risks, including the arrangements for internal governance and complaint mechanisms.

2. The obligation laid down in paragraph 1 applies to the first use of the high-risk AI system. The deployer may, in similar cases, rely on previously conducted fundamental rights impact assessments or existing impact assessments carried out by provider. If, during the use of the high-risk AI system, the deployer considers that any of the elements listed in paragraph 1 has changed or is no longer up to date, the deployer shall take the necessary steps to update the information.

3. Once the assessment referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article has been performed, the deployer shall notify the market surveillance authority of its results, submitting the filled-out template referred to in paragraph 5 of this Article as part of the notification. In the case referred to in [Article 46(1)](/en/ai-act/article-46), deployers may be exempt from that obligation to notify.

4. If any of the obligations laid down in this Article is already met through the data protection impact assessment conducted pursuant to [Article 35](/en/ai-act/article-35) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or [Article 27](/en/ai-act/article-27) of Directive (EU) 2016/680, the fundamental rights impact assessment referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall complement that data protection impact assessment.

5. The AI Office shall develop a template for a questionnaire, including through an automated tool, to facilitate deployers in complying with their obligations under this Article in a simplified manner.
