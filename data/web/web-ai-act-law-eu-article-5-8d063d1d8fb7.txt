### Introduction

The following AI practices shall be prohibited:

1. The following AI practices shall be prohibited:
    1. The placing on the market, the putting into service or the use of an AI system that deploys subliminal techniques beyond a person’s consciousness or purposefully manipulative or deceptive techniques, with the objective, or the effect of materially distorting the behavior of a person or a group of persons by appreciably impairing their ability to make an informed decision, thereby causing them to take a decision that they would not have otherwise taken in a manner that causes or is reasonably likely to cause that person, another person or group of persons significant harm.
    2. The placing on the market, the putting into service or the use of an AI system that exploits any of the vulnerabilities of a natural person or a specific group of persons due to their age, disability or a specific social or economic situation, with the objective, or the effect, of materially distorting the behavior of that person or a person belonging to that group in a manner that causes or is reasonably likely to cause that person or another person significant harm.
    3. The placing on the market, the putting into service or the use of an AI system for evaluating or classifying natural persons or groups of persons over a certain period of time based on their social behavior or known, inferred or predicted personal or personality characteristics, with either:
        1. Detrimental or unfavorable treatment of certain natural persons or groups of persons in social contexts that are unrelated to the contexts in which the data was originally generated or collected;
        2. Detrimental or unfavorable treatment of certain natural persons or groups of persons that is unjustified or disproportionate to their social behavior or its gravity.
    4. The placing on the market, the putting into service for this specific purpose, or the use of an AI system for making risk assessments of natural persons in order to assess and predict the risk of a natural person committing a criminal offense based solely on profiling of a natural person without assessing their personality traits and characteristics; this prohibition shall not apply to AI systems used to support human assessment efforts for medical purposes where direct link between objective and verifiable facts exists and are connected with criminal offenses.
    5. The placing on the market, the putting into service for this specific purpose, or the use of an AI system for analyzing facial features using “real-time” remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes unless and so far as such use is strictly necessary for one of several authorized purposes:
        1. Targeted search for specific victims of abduction, trafficking in human beings, sexual exploitation, etc., as well as search for missing persons;
        2. Prevention against serious threats to life safety;
        3. Localization and identification suspected criminals who commit crimes punishable by imprisonment longer than four years.
    
    Point (h) applies only if law enforcement authorities complete fundamental rights impact assessments as per Article 27 and register these systems in EU's database according to Article 49.

Point (h) can be implemented within limits and conditions set by Member States' national laws regarding temporal restrictions.

2. For law enforcement uses involving "real-time" remote biometric identification systems in public spaces:
    1. Uses must be deployed only after completing basic rights impact assessments and registering them in EU's database according to Article 49.
    2. Law enforcement authorities must ensure minimal safeguards and conditions regarding temporal and geographic limitations.

3. Each use involves law enforcement requires authorization granted by judicial authority/ independent administrative authority whose decision is binding upon request and within compliance with national law authorizing such use.

4. Authorization can be revoked if there are sufficient grounds for refusal.

5. Notifications should be submitted annually via Commission's website.

6. Annual reports published by Commission will include aggregated data but exclude sensitive operational data.

This Article does not affect prohibitions applying under other Union laws.
