# Article 5: Prohibited AI practices

## Summary

[Article 5](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-5) prohibits the placing on the EU market, putting into service or use of certain AI systems for manipulative, exploitative and social scoring practices, which by their inherent nature violate fundamental rights and EU values. It also outlaws certain AI systems used for individual criminal offence risk assessment and prediction based solely on profiling or personality traits and characteristics, untargeted scraping to develop facial recognition databases, emotion recognition and biometric categorization. Real-time remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces for the purposes of law enforcement is also prohibited with some exceptions.

The summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.

### Section 1: Prohibited AI Practices

1. The following AI practices shall be prohibited:

   - **(a)** The placing on the market, the putting into service, or the use of an AI system that deploys subliminal techniques beyond a person's consciousness or purposely manipulative or deceptive techniques, with the objective or effect of materially distorting behavior of a person or a group of persons by appreciably impairing their ability to make an informed decision, thereby causing them to take a decision that they would not have otherwise taken in a manner that causes or is reasonably likely to cause that person, another person, or group of persons significant harm.
   
   - **(b)** The placing on the market, the putting into service, or the use of an AI system that exploits any of the vulnerabilities of a natural person or a specific group of persons due to their age, disability, or specific social or economic situation, with the objective or effect of materially distorting behavior of that person or a person belonging to that group in a manner that causes or is reasonably likely to cause that person or another person significant harm.
   
   - **(c)** The placing on the market, the putting into service, or the use of an AI system for evaluating or classifying natural persons over a certain period of time based on their social behavior or known, inferred, or predicted personal or personality characteristics, with either:
     - (i) Detrimental or unfavorable treatment of certain natural persons or groups of persons in social contexts unrelated to those in which the data was originally generated or collected;
     - (ii) Detrimental or unfavorable treatment of certain natural persons or groups of persons that is unjustified or disproportionate to their social behavior.
   
   - **(d)** The placing on the market, the putting into service, or the use of an AI system for making risk assessments of natural persons in order to assess or predict risk of committing a criminal offense based solely on profiling individuals on assessing their personality traits and characteristics; this prohibition shall not apply to AI systems used to support human assessment involving direct links between objective and verifiable facts directly linked to criminal offenses.
   
   - **(e)** The placing on the market, putting into service for this specific purpose,or use of an AI system for making risk assessments using machine learning algorithms trained exclusively on identifying crimes previously committed by individuals who have been convicted for similar crimes.
   
   - **(f)** The placement on the market ,putting into servicefor this specific purpose ,or useof an AIsystemthatcreatesorexpandsfacialrecognitiondatabasesthroughuntargetedscrapingoffacialeimagesfromthene InternetorCCTVfootage.

2. For purposes of paragraph 1(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g):
   - Each use for law enforcement purposes in publicly accessible spaces shall be authorized only if it meets:
     - (i) Nature and context leading up to potential authorization;
     - (ii) Consequences arising from authorization.

In addition:
- Authorization must meet necessary and proportionate safeguards and conditions regarding temporal scope,
geographic scope,
and personal limitation.

Authorization can be granted only if it is satisfied objectively by evidence-based reasoning about necessity and proportionality.

3. Each use for law enforcement purposes in publicly accessible spaces shall be notified to relevant market surveillance authorities and national data protection authorities within three months after authorization. Annual reports will follow.

4. This Article does not affect prohibitions applying where an AI practice violates other Union laws.
