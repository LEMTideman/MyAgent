## Standardisation Should Play a Key Role

Standardisation should play a key role to provide technical solutions to providers to ensure compliance with this Regulation, in line with the state of the art, to promote innovation as well as competitiveness and growth in the single market. Compliance with harmonised standards as defined in [Article 2](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-2), point (1)(c), of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council(41), which are normally expected to reflect the state of the art, should be a means for providers to demonstrate conformity with the requirements of this Regulation. A balanced representation of interests involving all relevant stakeholders in the development of standards, in particular SMEs, consumer organisations and environmental and social stakeholders in accordance with Articles 5 and 6 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 should therefore be encouraged. In order to facilitate compliance, the standardisation requests should be issued by the Commission without undue delay. When preparing the standardisation request, the Commission should consult the advisory forum and the Board in order to collect relevant expertise. However, in the absence of relevant references to harmonised standards, the Commission should be able to establish, via implementing acts, and after consultation of the advisory forum, common specifications for certain requirements under this Regulation. The common specification should be an exceptional fallback solution to facilitate the provider’s obligation to comply with the requirements of this Regulation, when the standardization request has not been accepted by any of the European standardization organizations, or when the relevant harmonized standards insufficiently address fundamental rights concerns, or when the harmonized standards do not comply with the request, or when there are delays in the adoption of an appropriate harmonized standard. Where such a delay in the adoption of a harmonized standard is due to technical complexity of that standard, this should be considered by the Commission before contemplating establishing common specifications. When developing common specifications, the Commission is encouraged to cooperate with international partners and international standardization bodies.
