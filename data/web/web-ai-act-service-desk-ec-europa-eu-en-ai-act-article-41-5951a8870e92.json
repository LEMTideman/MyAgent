These specifications will be developed in consultation with the advisory forum and adopted through an examination procedure set out in [Article 98 (2)](/en/ai-act/article-98). AI systems conforming to these specifications will be presumed compliant with Section 2 of Chapter 3 (Requirements for high-risk AI systems) or, where applicable, certain obligations of Chapter 5. If harmonized standards are later adopted, the Commission will repeal the relevant implementing acts. Providers not complying with the common specifications must justify their alternative technical solutions. \n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n## Conditions for Adopting Implementing Acts\n\n1. The Commission may adopt, implementing acts establishing common specifications for the requirements set out in Section 2 of this Chapter or, as applicable, for the obligations set out in Sections 2 and 3 of Chapter V where:\n   - The Commission has requested, pursuant to [Article 10(1)](/en/ai-act/article-10) of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, one or more European standardization organizations to draft a harmonized standard for the requirements set out in Section 2 of this Chapter, or, as applicable, for the obligations set out in Sections 2 and 3 of Chapter V, and:\n     - The request has not been accepted by any of the European standardization organizations; or\n     - The harmonized standards addressing that request are not delivered within the deadline set in accordance with [Article 10(1)](/en/ai-act/article-10) of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012; or\n     - The relevant harmonized standards insufficiently address fundamental rights concerns; or\n     - The harmonized standards do not comply with the request;\n   - No reference to harmonized standards covering the requirements referred to in Section 2 of this Chapter or, as applicable, the obligations referred to in Sections 2 and 3 of Chapter V has been published in the Official Journal of the European Union in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, and no such reference is expected to be published within a reasonable period.\n\nWhen drafting the common specifications, the Commission shall consult the advisory forum referred to in [Article 67](/en/ai-act/article-67).\n\nThe implementing acts referred to in paragraph (a) shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in [Article 98(2)](/en/ai-act/article-98).\n\n### Related Recitals\n\n* [Recital 121](/en/ai-act/recital-121)\n* [Recital 122](/en/ai-act/recital-122)\n\n## Requiring Implementation Acts\n\n### Before Preparing Draft Implementing Act\n\nBefore preparing a draft implementing act, the Commission shall inform the committee referred to in [Article 22](/en/ai-act/article-22) of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 that it considers the conditions laid down in paragraph (a) of this Article to be fulfilled.\n\n### High-Risk AI Systems Presumed Compliant\n\nHigh-risk AI systems or general-purpose AI models which are in conformity with the common specifications referred to in paragraph (a), or parts thereof, shall be presumed to be in conformity with the requirements set out in Section 2 of this Chapter or, as applicable, to comply with the obligations referred to in Sections 2 and 3 of Chapter V, to the extent those common specifications cover those requirements or those obligations.\n\n### Where Harmonized Standards Are Required\n\nWhere a harmonized standard is adopted by a European standardization organization and proposed to be published by the Commission for inclusion in its reference list under Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012:\n\n* The Commission shall assess whether there is sufficient evidence supporting adoption.\n* If there is insufficient evidence supporting adoption based on existing documents provided by members participating in either part A or B of Annex III of Directive (EU) No EBAI(6)-797,\n* Or if there is no document providing evidence that compliance was assessed according to Article L.4(4)(c)(ii)-(v)(ii),\n* Or if there is no document confirming that compliance was assessed according to Article L.4(4)(c)(ii)-(v)(i),\n* Or if there is no document confirming that compliance was assessed according to Article L.4(4)(c)(ii)-(v)(iii),\n* Or if there is no document confirming that compliance was assessed according to Article L.4(4)(c)(ii)-(v)(iv),\n\nthe Commission shall notify member states accordingly.\n\n### Repeal After Publication\n\nIf references are subsequently published under Regulation (EU) No EBAI(6)-797,\n\n* The Commission shall repeal all implementing acts established under paragraph (a).\n* Any provisions concerning identical requirements covered by different implementations shall remain effective until they are repealed.\n\n### Consultation With Advisory Forum\n\nThe implementers should consult relevant committees before adopting an implementing act.\n\n## Legal Note\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).
