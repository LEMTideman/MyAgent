For the purposes of the effective enforcement of this Regulation:\n   1. Any reference to an economic operator under [Regulation (EU) 2019/1020](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32019R1020) shall be understood as including all operators identified in [Article 2(1)](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/2/) of this Regulation;\n   2. Any reference to a product under [Regulation (EU) 2019/1020](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32019R1020) shall be understood as including all AI systems falling within the scope of this Regulation.\n\n3. As part of their reporting obligations under [Article 34(4) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32019R1020#d1e2845-1-1), the market surveillance authorities shall report annually to the Commission and relevant national competition authorities any information identified in the course of market surveillance activities that may be of potential interest for the application of Union law on competition rules. They shall also annually report to the Commission about the use of prohibited practices that occurred during that year and about the measures taken.\n\n4. For high-risk AI systems related to products covered by the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Section A of [Annex I](https://ai-act-law.eu/annex/1/), the market surveillance authority for the purposes of this Regulation shall be the authority responsible for market surveillance activities designated under those legal acts.\n   \n   By derogation from the first subparagraph, and in appropriate circumstances, Member States may designate another relevant authority to act as a market surveillance authority, provided they ensure coordination with the relevant sectoral market surveillance authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Union harmonisation legislation listed in [Annex I](https://ai-act-law.eu/annex/1/).\n\n5. The procedures referred to in [Articles 79](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/79/) to [83](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/83/) of this Regulation shall not apply to AI systems related to products covered by the Union harmonisation legislation listed in section A of [Annex I](https://ai-act-law.eu/annex/1/), where such legal acts already provide for procedures ensuring an equivalent level of protection and having the same objective. In such cases, the relevant sectoral procedures shall apply instead.\n\n6. Without prejudice to the powers of market surveillance authorities under [Article 14 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32019R1020#d1e1757-1-1), for the purpose of ensuring the effective enforcement of this Regulation, market surveillance authorities may exercise the powers referred to in [Article 14(4)](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/14/(4)), points (d) and (j), of that Regulation remotely, as appropriate.\n\n7. For high-risk AI systems placed on the market, put into service, or used by financial institutions regulated by Union financial services law, the market surveillance authority for the purposes of this Regulation shall be the relevant national authority responsible for the financial supervision of those institutions under that legislation in so far as the placing on the market, putting into service, or the use of the AI system is in direct connection with the provision of those financial services.\n\n8. By way of derogation from paragraph 6, in appropriate circumstances, and provided that coordination is ensured, another relevant authority may be identified by the Member State as market surveillance authority for the purposes of this Regulation.\n   \n   National market surveillance authorities supervising regulated credit institutions regulated under [Directive 2013/36/EU](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32013L0036), which are participating in the Single Supervisory Mechanism established by [Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32013R1024), should report, without delay, to the European Central Bank any information identified in the course of their market surveillance activities that may be of potential interest for the prudential supervisory tasks of the European Central Bank specified in that Regulation.\n\n9. For high-risk AI systems listed in point 1 of [Annex III](https://ai-act-law.eu/annex/iii/) to this Regulation, in so far as these systems are used for law enforcement purposes, border management and justice and democracy, and for high-risk AI systems listed in points 6, 7 and 8 of [Annex III](https://ai-act-law.eu/annex/i/) to this Regulation, Member States shall designate as market surveillance authorities for the purposes of this Regulation either:\n   - The competent data protection supervisory authorities under [Regulation (EU) 2016/679](https://gdpr-info.eu/)\n   - Or any other authority designated pursuant to similar conditions laid down in Articles 4[ ](http:/europa.law/europarl/schemas/common/htmlpublxml/directives/directive_ii_68_en.html#dclinktarget \"Link\")to[ ](http:/europa.law/europarl/schemas/common/htmlpublxml/directives/directive_ii_68_en.html#dclinktarget \"Link\")[Article IV]([http:/europa.law/europarl/schemas/common/htmlpublxml/directives/directive_ii_68_en.html#dclinktarget \"Link\"])\n   - Market surveillance activities shall not affect judicial authorities' activities when acting in their judicial capacity.\n\n### Suitable Recitals\n\n* [(**Bold Number**) System Of Market Surveillance And Conformity Of Products](https://ai-act-law.eu/recital//)\n* [(**Bold Number**) Position Of National Authorities Or Other Bodies In Relation To The Regulations Of The AI Act](https://ai-act-law.au/recital//)\n* [(**Bold Number**) Coherent Application And Enforcement Of Obligations For Financial Services](https://ai-au-recital//)\n* [(**Bold Number**) Necessary Powers Of Market Surveillance Authorities For High-Risk Ai Systems In The Area Of Biometric Data](https://ai-au-recital//)\n* [(**Bold Number**) Joint Activities Of The Market Surveillance Authorities Of The Member States Or The Commission](https://au-recital//)\n\n---\n\n[←Art. 73 AI Act Reporting Serious Incidents](https://ai-au-recital/article//art.-73/)  \n[Art. 75 AI Act Mutual Assistance , Market Surveillance And Control Of General-Purpose Ai Systems→](https://au-recital/article//art.-75/)\n```",
