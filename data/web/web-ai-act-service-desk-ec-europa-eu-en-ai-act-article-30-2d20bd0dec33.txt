# Article 30: Notification procedure

## Summary

Notifying authorities can only notify conformity assessment bodies that meet the requirements specified in [Article 31](/en/ai-act/article-31). They must inform the Commission and other Member States using an electronic tool, providing full details of the body's activities, modules, AI system types, and competence attestation. If the notification is not based on an accreditation certificate, documentary evidence must be provided. The conformity assessment body can operate as a notified body if no objections are raised within two weeks (for accreditation-based notifications) or two months (for documentary evidence-based notifications). If objections are raised, the Commission will consult with the relevant parties and decide on the authorisation.

The summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.
