## General Description of the General-Purpose AI Model

1. A general description of the general-purpose AI model including:
   - The tasks that the model is intended to perform and the type and nature of AI systems into which it can be integrated;
   - The acceptable use policies applicable;
   - The date of release and methods of distribution;
   - How the model interacts, or can be used to interact, with hardware or software that is not part of the model itself, where applicable;
   - The versions of relevant software related to the use of the general-purpose AI model, where applicable;
   - The architecture and number of parameters;
   - The modality (e.g., text, image) and format of inputs and outputs;
   - The license for the model.

2. A description of the elements of the model and of the process for its development, including:
   - The technical means (e.g., instructions for use, infrastructure, tools) required for the general-purpose AI model to be integrated into AI systems;
   - The modality (e.g., text, image, etc.) and format of the inputs and outputs and their maximum size (e.g., context window length, etc.);
   - Information on the data used for training, testing, and validation, where applicable, including the type and provenance of data and curation methodologies.

## Elements Used in Development

1. A description of how to integrate a general-purpose AI model into other AI systems using appropriate technologies.
2. An outline of processes involved in developing a general-purpose AI model from raw data.
3. Details about curating datasets used during development.
4. Information on licensing agreements associated with a general-purpose AI model.
