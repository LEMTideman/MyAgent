To that end, providers of general-purpose AI models should put in place a policy to comply with Union law on copyright and related rights, in particular to identify and comply with the reservation of rights expressed by rightsholders pursuant to [Article 4(3)](/en/ai-act/article-4) of Directive (EU) 2019/790. Any provider placing a general-purpose AI model on the Union market should comply with this obligation, regardless of the jurisdiction in which the copyright-relevant acts underpinning the training of those general-purpose AI models take place. This is necessary to ensure a level playing field among providers of general-purpose AI models where no provider should be able to gain a competitive advantage in the Union market by applying lower copyright standards than those provided in the Union.\n\n### Related Articles\n\nThis Recital relates to:\n\n*   [Article 16: Obligations of providers of high-risk AI systems](/en/ai-act/article-16)\n*   [Article 53: Obligations for providers of general-purpose AI models](/en/ai-act/article-53)\n\n---\n\n## Contact Us\n\n*   [Contact the AI Office](mailto:CNECT-AIOFFICE@ec.europa.eu)\n\n## About Us\n\n*   [Copyright notice](/en/copyright-notice)\n*   [Legal notice](/en/legal-notice)\n*   [Privacy statement](/en/privacy-statement-ai-act-service-desk-website)\n*   [About Directorate-General CONNECT](https://commission.europa.eu/about-departments-and-executive-agencies/communications-networks-content-and-technology_en)\n\n[![European Commission Logo](https://webtools.europa.eu/images/flags/eu.svg)](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en \"European Commission\")\n\n**AI Act Service Desk**\n\nThis site is managed by:\nDirectorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology\n\n*   [Accessibility](/en/accessibility-statement)\n\n**Contact Us**\n*   [Contact the AI Office](mailto:CNECT-AIOFFICE@ec.europa.eu)\n\n**About Us**\n*   [Copyright notice](/en/copyright-notice)\n*   [Legal notice](/en/legal-notice)\n*   [Privacy statement](/en/privacy-statement-ai-act-service-desk-website)\n*   [About Directorate-General CONNECT](https://commission.europa.eu/about-departments-and-executive-agencies/communications-networks-content-and-technology_en)\n\n[![European Commission Logo Negative](https://webtools.europa.eu/images/logo/negative/logo-ec--en.svg)](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en \"European Commission\")\n```",
