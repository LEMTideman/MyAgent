If an AI system is deemed to present a risk, the authority will evaluate its compliance with the AI Act, with particular attention on risks to vulnerable groups. If non-compliance is found, the authority will require corrective actions, including potential withdrawal or recall of the AI system. The authority will inform the European Commission and other Member States if the non-compliance is not limited to its territory. If the operator does not take adequate corrective action, the authority will take provisional measures to restrict or prohibit the AI system and notify other authorities. The measures will be deemed justified if no objections are raised within three months, or 30 days for serious non-compliance.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n1. AI systems presenting a risk shall be understood as a 'product presenting a risk' as defined in [Article 3](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-3), point 19 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, in so far as they present risks to the health or safety, or to fundamental rights, of persons.\n\n2. Where the market surveillance authority of a Member State has sufficient reason to consider an AI system to present a risk as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, it shall carry out an evaluation of the AI system concerned in respect of its compliance with all the requirements and obligations laid down in this Regulation. Particular attention shall be given to AI systems presenting a risk to vulnerable groups. Where risks to fundamental rights are identified, the market surveillance authority shall also inform and fully cooperate with the relevant national public authorities or bodies referred to in [Article 77(1)](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-77). The relevant operators shall cooperate as necessary with the market surveillance authority and with the other national public authorities or bodies referred to in [Article 77(1)](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-77).\n\n   Where, in the course of that evaluation, the market surveillance authority or, where applicable, the market surveillance authority in cooperation with the national public authority referred to in [Article 77(1)](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-77), finds that the AI system does not comply with the requirements and obligations laid down in this Regulation, it shall without undue delay require the relevant operator to take all appropriate corrective actions to bring the AI system into compliance, to withdraw the AI system from the market, or to recall it within a period specified by the market surveillance authority. In any event, within 15 working days after receiving notification about non-compliance or within 30 days after discovery of serious non-compliance.\n\n   The market surveillance authority shall inform the relevant notified body accordingly. [Article 18](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-18) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 shall apply to measures taken under paragraph 2.\n\n3. Where the market surveillance authority considers that non-compliance is not restricted to its national territory, it shall inform the Commission and other Member States without undue delay of results of evaluation and actions taken.\n\n4. The operator shall ensure that all appropriate corrective action is taken in respect of all existing products or standalone AI systems that have been made available on Union markets.\n\n5. Where an operator does not take adequate corrective action within specified periods (or less than 30 days for serious non-compliance), market surveillance authorities can take provisional measures such as prohibiting or restricting availability on domestic markets without undue delay.\n\n6. The notification must include details like product identification, origin of products and supply chains; nature of alleged non-compliances; types and durations of national measures taken; arguments presented by operators regarding reasons for non-compliance; violations leading up to these measures; objections raised by either local supervisory authorities or Commission; objections raised by operators themselves; etc.\n\n   When there's no objection raised within three months (or 30 days for serious breaches), those measures become justified without prejudice against operators' procedural rights under [Article 18](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-18) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020.\n\n7. Market surveillance authorities must ensure appropriate restrictions are applied across products or services affected by non-compliance.\n\n### Relevant Recitals\n\n* [Recital 97](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-97)\n* [Recital 104](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-104)\n* [Recital 160](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-160)\n\nView:\n[Official Text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689)\n```",
