This is only permitted if the AI system is being developed for the public interest, such as public safety, health, environmental protection, energy sustainability, transport safety, and public administration. Certain conditions must be met. These include necessity, effective risk monitoring, data isolation, compliance with data protection laws, and documentation of processes. Personal data must be protected and deleted after use, and a summary of the project must be published. Law enforcement activities are subject to specific laws and the same conditions. The provisions of this article do not override existing data protection laws.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n1. In the AI regulatory sandbox, personal data lawfully collected for other purposes may be processed solely for the purpose of developing, training and testing certain AI systems in the sandbox when all of the following conditions are met:\n\n   - **(a)** AI systems shall be developed for safeguarding substantial public interest by a public authority or another natural or legal person and in one or more of the following areas:\n     - Public safety and public health, including disease detection, diagnosis prevention, control and treatment and improvement of health care systems;\n     - A high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment, protection of biodiversity, protection against pollution, green transition measures, climate change mitigation and adaptation measures;\n     - Energy sustainability;\n     - Safety and resilience of transport systems and mobility, critical infrastructure and networks;\n     - Efficiency and quality of public administration and public services;\n\n   - **(b)** The data processed are necessary for complying with one or more of the requirements referred to in Chapter III, Section 2 where those requirements cannot effectively be fulfilled by processing anonymized, synthetic or other non-personal data;\n\n   - **(c)** There are effective monitoring mechanisms to identify if any high risks to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects as referred to in [Article 35](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-35) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and in [Article 39](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-39) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 may arise during the sandbox experimentation, as well as response mechanisms to promptly mitigate those risks and, where necessary, stop the processing;\n\n   - **(d)** Any personal data to be processed in the context of the sandbox are in a functionally separate, isolated and protected data processing environment under the control of the prospective provider and only authorized persons have access to those data;\n\n   - **(e)** Providers can further share the originally collected data only in accordance with Union data protection law; any personal data created in the sandbox cannot be shared outside the sandbox;\n\n   - **(f)** Any processing of personal data in the context of the sandbox neither leads to measures or decisions affecting the data subjects nor does it affect the application of their rights laid down in Union law on the protection of personal data;\n\n   - **(g)** Any personal data processed in the context of the sandbox are protected by means of appropriate technical and organizational measures and deleted once participation in the sandbox has terminated or once they have reached their end retention period;\n\n   - **(h)** The logs of processing personal data in context of sandbox are kept for duration of participation in sandbox unless provided otherwise by Union or national law;\n\n   - **(i)** A complete description about process & rationale behind training/testing/validation is kept together with testing results as part technical documentation referred to [Annex IV](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-4);\n\n   - **(j)** A short summary about AI project developed in sandbox & its objectives & expected results should be published on website maintained by competent authorities; this obligation shall not cover sensitive operational data related to activities law enforcement border control immigration asylum authorities.\n\n2. For purposes aimed at prevention investigation detection prosecution criminal offenses execution criminal penalties including safeguarding against threat public security under control responsibility law enforcement authorities processing personal data within AI regulatory sandboxes shall rely on specific Union or national law subjecting same cumulative conditions as outlined above.\n\n3. Paragraph 1 is without prejudice to Union or national law excluding processing personal data for other purposes than those explicitly mentioned in that law besides Union or national law providing basis for processing personal data which is necessary for development testing or training innovative AI systems or any other legal basis laid down Union law on protection personalデータ.\n\n### Relevant Recitals\n\n* [Recital 138](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-138)\n* [Recital 139](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-139)\n* [Recital 140](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-140)\n* [Recital 142](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-142)\n* [Recital 143](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-143)\n* [Recital 144](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-144)\n* [Recital 145](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-145)\n\nView official text: [Artificial Intelligence Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/html/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).\n```",
