The technical documentation of a high-risk AI system shall be drawn up before that system is placed on the market or put into service and shall be kept up-to-date.\n   \n    **Note:** 1 The technical documentation shall be drawn up in such a way as to demonstrate that the high-risk AI system complies with the requirements set out in this Section and to provide national competent authorities and notified bodies with the necessary information in a clear and comprehensive form to assess the compliance of the AI system with those requirements. 2 It shall contain, at a minimum, the elements set out in [Annex IV](https://ai-act-law.eu/annex/4/). 3 SMEs, including start-ups, may provide the elements of the technical documentation specified in [Annex IV](https://ai-act-law.eu/annex/4/) in a simplified manner. 4 To that end, the Commission shall establish a simplified technical documentation form targeted at the needs of small and microenterprises. 5 Where an SME, including a start-up, opts to provide the information required in [Annex IV](https://ai-act-law.eu/annex/4/) in a simplified manner, it shall use the form referred to in this paragraph. 6 Notified bodies shall accept the form for the purposes of the conformity assessment.\n\n2.
