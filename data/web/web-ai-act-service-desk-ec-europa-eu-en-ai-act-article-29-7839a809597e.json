The application includes details of their activities, modules, and AI system types they can assess. They should include an accreditation certificate if available, or documentary evidence of compliance with requirements. Existing designations under other EU legislation can support the application. Bodies must update their documentation whenever relevant changes occur to ensure continuous compliance.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n1. Conformity assessment bodies shall submit an application for notification to the notifying authority of the Member State in which they are established.\n2. The application for notification shall be accompanied by:\n   - A description of the conformity assessment activities, conformity assessment module(s), and types of AI systems for which the conformity assessment body claims to be competent.\n   - An accreditation certificate, where one exists, issued by a national accreditation body attesting that the conformity assessment body fulfills the requirements laid down in [Article 31](/en/ai-act/article-31).\n   - Any valid document related to existing designations of the applicant notified body under any other Union harmonization legislation.\n3. Where the conformity assessment body cannot provide an accreditation certificate, it shall provide the notifying authority with all the documentary evidence necessary for verification, recognition, and regular monitoring of its compliance with the requirements laid down in [Article 31](/en/ai-act/article-31).\n\n#### Relevant Recitals\n- [Recital 9](/en/ai-act/recital-9)\n- [Recital 153](/en/ai-act/recital-153)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).
