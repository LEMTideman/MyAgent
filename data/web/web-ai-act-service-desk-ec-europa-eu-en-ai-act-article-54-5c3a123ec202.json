These providers must appoint an authorised representative in the EU to ensure compliance with the AI Act. The representative verifies documentation, keeps records, and cooperates with authorities. The representative can terminate the mandate if the provider fails to comply with the AI Act. Open-source general-purpose AI models are exempt from these requirements unless they are classified as general-purpose AI models with systemic risks.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n## Section 2: Obligations for Providers of General-Purpose AI Models\n\n### 1. Prior to Placing a General-Purpose AI Model on the Union Market\n\nPrior to placing a general-purpose AI model on the Union market, providers established in third countries shall, by written mandate, appoint an authorised representative which is established in the Union.\n\n### 2. Appointment and Mandate\n\nThe provider shall enable its authorised representative to perform the tasks specified in the mandate received from the provider.\n\n### 3. Tasks Performed by Authorised Representative\n\nThe authorised representative shall perform the following tasks:\n\n- **Verify that technical documentation specified in [Annex XI](/en/ai-act/annex-11) has been drawn up and all obligations referred to in [Article 53](/en/ai-act/article-53) and, where applicable, [Article 55](/en/ai-act/article-55) have been fulfilled by the provider;**\n- **Keep a copy of the technical documentation specified in [Annex XI](/en/ai-act/annex-11) at the disposal of the AI Office and national competent authorities, for a period of 10 years after the general-purpose AI model has been placed on the market, and provide contact details of the provider that appointed the authorised representative;**\n- **Provide information and documentation necessary to demonstrate compliance with obligations in this Chapter upon reasonable requests;**\n- **Cooperate with relevant authorities and entities regarding actions taken against a general-purpose AI model during integration into other systems placed on the market or put into service within Europe;**\n\n### 4. Additional Rights\n\nThe mandate empowers the authorised representative to be addressed by both or instead of the provider on matters related to ensuring compliance with this Regulation.\n\n### 5. Termination of Mandate\n\nIf it becomes evident that a provider is acting contrary to their obligations under this Regulation, it may be terminated. This termination must be communicated immediately to both parties involved.\n\n### 6. Information Sharing\n\nThe authorised representative will promptly inform the AI Office or competent authorities about any termination of their mandate due to non-compliance by a provider.\n\n---\n\n## Relevant Recitals\n\n*   [Recital 82](/en/ai-act/recital-82)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).
