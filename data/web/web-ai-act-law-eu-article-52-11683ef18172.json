Where a general-purpose AI model meets the condition referred to in [Article 51(1)](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/51/), point (a), the relevant provider shall notify the Commission without delay and in any event within two weeks after that requirement is met or it becomes known that it will be met.\n2. That notification shall include the information necessary to demonstrate that the relevant requirement has been met.\n3. If the Commission becomes aware of a general-purpose AI model presenting systemic risks of which it has not been notified, it may decide to designate it as a model with systemic risk.\n\nThe provider of a general-purpose AI model that meets the condition referred to in [Article 51(1)](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/51/), point (a), may present, with its notification, sufficiently substantiated arguments to demonstrate that, exceptionally, although it meets that requirement, the general-purpose AI model does not present, due to its specific characteristics, systemic risks and therefore should not be classified as a general-purpose AI model with systemic risk.\n\nWhere the Commission concludes that the arguments submitted pursuant to paragraph 2 are not sufficiently substantiated and the relevant provider was not able to demonstrate that the general-purpose AI model does not present, due to its specific characteristics, systemic risks, it shall reject those arguments, and the general-purpose AI model shall be considered to be a general-purpose AI model with systemic risk.\n\nThe Commission may designate a general-purpose AI model as presenting systemic risks, ex officio or following a qualified alert from the scientific panel pursuant to [Article 90(1)](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/90/), point (a), on the basis of criteria set out in [Annex XIII](https://ai-act-law.eu/annex/13/) but only if those criteria are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nThe Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with [Article 97](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/97/) in order to amend [Annex XIII](https://ai-act-law.eu/annex/13/) by specifying and updating the criteria set out in that Annex.\n\nIf a reasoned request of a provider whose model has been designated as a general-purpose AI model with systemic risk pursuant to paragraph 4 is received by the Commission, it shall take such request into account and may decide to reassess whether the general-purpose AI model can still be considered to present systemic risks on the basis of the criteria set out in [Annex XIII](https://ai-act-law.eu/annex/13/) but only if those criteria are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nSuch a request shall contain objective, detailed and new reasons that have arisen since the designation decision. Providers may request reassessment at least six months after the designation decision. Where the Commission, following its reassessment, decides to maintain the designation as a general-purpose AI model with systemic risk, providers may request reassessment at least six months after that decision.\n\nThe Commission shall ensure that a list of general-purpose AI models with systemic risk is published and shall keep that list up to date without prejudice to their protection of intellectual property rights and confidential business information or trade secrets in accordance with Union and national law.\n```",
