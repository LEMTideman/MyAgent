# Article 36: Changes to notifications

## Summary

Notifying authorities must inform the Commission and other Member States of any changes to a notified body's status. If a notified body decides to stop its conformity assessment activities, it must inform the notifying authority and affected providers immediately, and, in case of planned cessation, at least one year before ceasing operations. The notified body's certificates can remain valid for nine months after it stops, provided another notified body agrees to take over responsibility for the high-risk AI systems. If a notified body no longer meets requirements, the notifying authority will investigate and may restrict, suspend, or withdraw its designation, informing the Commission and other Member States. The notified body must then inform providers within 10 days. The notifying authority will assess the impact on issued certificates, submit a report, and ensure that unduly issued certificates are suspended or withdrawn. Certificates remain valid under certain conditions during suspension, restriction, or withdrawal, with another notified body assuming responsibility if needed.

The summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.

## Section 4: Notifying Authorities and Notified Bodies

### Article 36: Changes to notifications

#### Summary

Notifying authorities must inform the Commission and the other Member States of any relevant changes to the notification of a notified body via the electronic notification tool referred to in [Article 30(2)](/en/ai-act/article-30).

#### Paragraphs

1. The notifying authority shall notify the Commission and the other Member States of any relevant changes to the notification of a notified body via the electronic notification tool referred to in [Article 30(2)](/en/ai-act/article-30).
   
2. The procedures laid down in Articles 29 and 30 shall apply to extensions of the scope of the notification.
   For changes to the notification other than extensions of its scope, the procedures laid down in paragraphs (3) to (9) shall apply.
   
3. Where a notified body decides to cease its conformity assessment activities, it shall inform the notifying authority and the providers concerned as soon as possible and, in the case of a planned cessation, at least one year before ceasing its activities. The certificates of the notified body may remain valid for a period of nine months after cessation of the notified body’s activities, on condition that another notified body has confirmed in writing that it will assume responsibilities for the high-risk AI systems covered by those certificates. The latter notified body shall complete a full assessment of the high-risk AI systems affected by the end of that nine-month-period before issuing new certificates for those systems. Where the notified body has ceased its activity, the notifying authority shall withdraw the designation.
   
4. Where a notifying authority has sufficient reason to consider that a notified body no longer meets the requirements laid down in [Article 31](/en/ai-act/article-31), or that it is failing to fulfill its obligations, the notifying authority shall without delay investigate the matter with utmost diligence. In that context, it shall inform the notified body concerned about the objections raised and give it the possibility to make its views known. If the notifying authority comes to conclude that:
   - (a) The notified body no longer meets requirements laid down in [Article 31](/en/ai-act/article-31) or fails to fulfill obligations.
   - (b) There is no risk to health, safety or fundamental rights associated with certificates affected by suspension or restriction.
   - (c) Another qualified notified body assumes immediate responsibility for high-risk AI systems affected by suspension or restriction.
   Then:
   - (i) It assesses impact on issued certificates.
   - (ii) It submits report on findings within three months.
   - (iii) It requires certified bodies unduly issued be suspended or withdrawn if applicable.
   - (iv) It informs Commission and Member States about certificates requiring suspension or withdrawal.
   - (v) It provides national competent authorities with information about certificates affected by suspension or withdrawal.
   
5. Withdrawing designation due to cessation:
   - (a) National competent authority confirms there is no risk.
   - (b) Another notified body confirms assumption of responsibilities.

6. Upon withdrawal:

7. Certificates remain valid for up to nine months under these circumstances:
   - (a) National competent authority confirms there is no risk.
   - (b) Another qualified notified body confirms assumption of responsibilities.

8. Additional periods:
   - Nine months per certificate until next certification cycle ends.

9. Extension periods:
   - Three months maximum per certificate unless approved by commission.
