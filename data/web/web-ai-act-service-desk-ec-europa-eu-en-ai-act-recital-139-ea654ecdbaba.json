Moreover, the AI regulatory sandboxes should aim to enhance legal certainty for innovators and the competent authorities’ oversight and understanding of the opportunities, emerging risks, and the impacts of AI use, to facilitate regulatory learning for authorities and undertakings, including with a view to future adaptations of the legal framework, to support cooperation and the sharing of best practices with the authorities involved in the AI regulatory sandbox, and to accelerate access to markets, including by removing barriers for SMEs, including start-ups. AI regulatory sandboxes should be widely available throughout the Union, and particular attention should be given to their accessibility for SMEs, including start-ups. The participation in the AI regulatory sandbox should focus on issues that raise legal uncertainty for providers and prospective providers to innovate, experiment with AI in the Union, and contribute to evidence-based regulatory learning. The supervision of the AI systems in the AI regulatory sandbox should therefore cover their development, training, testing, and validation before they are placed on the market or put into service, as well as the notion and occurrence of substantial modifications that may require a new conformity assessment procedure. Any significant risks identified during the development and testing of such AI systems should result in adequate mitigation and, failing that, in the suspension of the development and testing process. Where appropriate, national competent authorities establishing AI regulatory sandboxes should cooperate with other relevant authorities, including those supervising the protection of fundamental rights, and could allow for the involvement of other actors within the AI ecosystem such as national or European standardisation organizations, notified bodies, testing and experimentation facilities, research and experimentation labs, European Digital Innovation Hubs, and relevant stakeholder and civil society organizations. To ensure uniform implementation across the Union and economies of scale, it is appropriate to establish common rules for the AI regulatory sandboxes’ implementation and a framework for cooperation between these relevant authorities involved in the supervision of the sandboxes. AI regulatory sandboxes established under this Regulation should be without prejudice to other laws allowing for the establishment of other sandboxes aimed at ensuring compliance with law other than this Regulation. Where appropriate, relevant competent authorities in charge of those other regulatory sandboxes should consider the benefits of using those sandboxes also for purposes of ensuring compliance with this Regulation. Upon agreement between national competent authorities and participants in the AI regulatory sandbox:\n- Testing in real-world conditions may also be operated and supervised in accordance with Article 76(2)(c) if appropriate.\n\n## This Recital relates to\n\n- [Article 57: AI regulatory sandboxes](/en/ai-act/article-57)\n- [Article 58: Detailed arrangements for, and functioning of, AI regulatory sandboxes](/en/ai-act/article-58)\n- [Article 59: Further processing of personal data for developing certain AI systems in public interest](/en/ai-act/article-59)\n- [Article 62: Measures for providers and deployers](/en/ai-act/article-62)\n- [Article 76: Supervision of testing in real-world conditions](/en/ai-act/article-76)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).
