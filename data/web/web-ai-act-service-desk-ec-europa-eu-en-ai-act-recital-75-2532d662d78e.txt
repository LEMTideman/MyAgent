# Recital 75

## Technical Robustness

Technical robustness is a key requirement for high-risk AI systems. They should be resilient in relation to harmful or otherwise undesirable behavior that may result from limitations within the systems or the environment in which the systems operate (e.g., errors, faults, inconsistencies, unexpected situations). Therefore, technical and organizational measures should be taken to ensure robustness of high-risk AI systems, for example by designing and developing appropriate technical solutions to prevent or minimize harmful or otherwise undesirable behavior. Those technical solutions may include, for instance, mechanisms enabling the system to safely interrupt its operation (fail-safe plans) in the presence of certain anomalies or when operation takes place outside certain predetermined boundaries. Failure to protect against these risks could lead to safety impacts or negatively affect the fundamental rights, such as due to erroneous decisions or wrong or biased outputs generated by the AI system.
