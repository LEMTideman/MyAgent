Art. 48 AI Act - CE marking
===========================

1. The CE marking shall be subject to the general principles set out in [Article 30](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32008R0765#d1e1664-30-1) of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008.
2. For high-risk AI systems provided digitally, a digital CE marking shall be used, only if it can easily be accessed via the interface from which that system is accessed or via an easily accessible machine-readable code or other electronic means.
3. **1** The CE marking shall be affixed visibly, legibly and indelibly for high-risk AI systems. **2** Where that is not possible or not warranted on account of the nature of the high-risk AI system, it shall be affixed to the packaging or to the accompanying documentation, as appropriate.
4. **1** Where applicable, the CE marking shall be followed by the identification number of the notified body responsible for the conformity assessment procedures set out in [Article 43](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/43/). **2** The identification number of the notified body shall be affixed by the body itself or, under its instructions, by the provider or by the provider’s authorised representative. **3** The identification number shall also be indicated in any promotional material which mentions that the high-risk AI system fulfils the requirements for CE marking.
5. Where high-risk AI systems are subject to other Union law which also provides for the affixing of the CE marking, the CE marking shall indicate that the high-risk AI system also fulfill the requirements of that other law.
