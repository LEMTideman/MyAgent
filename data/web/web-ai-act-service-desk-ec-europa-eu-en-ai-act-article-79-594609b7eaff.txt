# Article 79: Procedure at national level for dealing with AI systems presenting a risk

## Summary

This article details the procedures for market surveillance authorities to evaluate and address risks posed by AI systems. If an AI system is deemed to present a risk, the authority will evaluate its compliance with the AI Act, with particular attention on risks to vulnerable groups. If non-compliance is found, the authority will require corrective actions, including potential withdrawal or recall of the AI system. The authority will inform the European Commission and other Member States if the non-compliance is not limited to its territory. If the operator does not take adequate corrective action, the authority will take provisional measures to restrict or prohibit the AI system and notify other authorities. The measures will be deemed justified if no objections are raised within three months, or 30 days for serious non-compliance.

The summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.

1. AI systems presenting a risk shall be understood as a 'product presenting a risk' as defined in [Article 3](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-3), point 19 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, in so far as they present risks to the health or safety, or to fundamental rights, of persons.

2. Where the market surveillance authority of a Member State has sufficient reason to consider an AI system to present a risk as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, it shall carry out an evaluation of the AI system concerned in respect of its compliance with all the requirements and obligations laid down in this Regulation. Particular attention shall be given to AI systems presenting a risk to vulnerable groups. Where risks to fundamental rights are identified, the market surveillance authority shall also inform and fully cooperate with the relevant national public authorities or bodies referred to in [Article 77(1)](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-77). The relevant operators shall cooperate as necessary with the market surveillance authority and with the other national public authorities or bodies referred to in [Article 77(1)](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-77).

   Where, in the course of that evaluation, the market surveillance authority or, where applicable, the market surveillance authority in cooperation with the national public authority referred to in [Article 77(1)](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-77), finds that the AI system does not comply with the requirements and obligations laid down in this Regulation, it shall without undue delay require the relevant operator to take all appropriate corrective actions to bring the AI system into compliance, to withdraw the AI system from the market, or to recall it within a period specified by the market surveillance authority; however, in any event within a shorter time frame than prescribed by law.

   The market surveillance authority shall inform the relevant notified body accordingly. [Article 18](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-18) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 shall apply to these measures.

3. Where the market surveillance authority considers that non-compliance is not restricted to its national territory, it shall inform the Commission and the other Member States without undue delay about their findings.

4. The operator must ensure that all appropriate corrective action is taken regarding all existing products or standalone AI systems that have been made available on Europe's market.

5. Where there is no timely response from an operator who fails to implement corrective actions after receiving notices from market surveillance authorities concerning non-compliance:

   - **Prohibition**: A temporary ban can be imposed on making new products available on Europe's markets.
   - **Withdrawal**: Products already sold could be removed from sale.
   
6. Once all efforts have failed and there is still no effective remedy being implemented by an operator:
   
   - **Notification**: The Commission and member states should be informed immediately.
   
   - **Actionable Measures**: All possible steps should be taken before taking administrative decisions like suspending operations or imposing fines.
   
   - **Objections Period**: There needs to be at least three months between when notices were received and any objections were filed; otherwise, measures would need approval within six months instead.
   
7. When multiple objections remain unresolved after three months:
   
   - **Justification Decision**: Decisions based solely on lack of objections would not hold up under legal scrutiny unless no valid grounds exist against them.
   
8. Additional measures:
   
   - Ensure proper restrictions on affected products through immediate bans.
