Where an AI system is based on a general-purpose AI model, and the model and the system are developed by the same provider, the AI Office shall have powers to monitor and supervise compliance of that AI system with obligations under this Regulation.\n2. To carry out its monitoring and supervision tasks, the AI Office shall have all the powers of a market surveillance authority provided for in this Section and [Regulation (EU) 2019/1020](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32019R1020).\n\nWhere the relevant market surveillance authorities have sufficient reason to consider general-purpose AI systems that can be used directly by deployers for at least one purpose that is classified as high-risk pursuant to this Regulation to be non-compliant with the requirements laid down in this Regulation, they shall cooperate with the AI Office to carry out compliance evaluations, and shall inform the Board and other market surveillance authorities accordingly.\n\n1. Where a market surveillance authority is unable to conclude its investigation of the high-risk AI system because of its inability to access certain information related to the general-purpose AI model despite having made all appropriate efforts to obtain that information, it may submit a reasoned request to the AI Office, by which access to that information shall be enforced.\n2. In that case, the AI Office shall supply to the applicant authority without delay, and in any event within 30 days, any information that the AI Office considers to be relevant in order to establish whether a high-risk AI system is non-compliant.\n3. Market surveillance authorities shall safeguard the confidentiality of the information that they obtain in accordance with [Article 78](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/78/) of this Regulation.\n4. The procedure provided for in [Chapter VI of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32019R1020#d1e2152-1-1) shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n\nSuitable Recitals\n-----------------\n\n* [(161)](https://ai-act-law.eu/recital/161/) Clarification of responsibilities and competencies\n* [(162)](https://ai-act-law.eu/recital/162/) Synergies at Union level\n* [(163)](https://ai-act-law.eu/recital/163/) Support for the AI Office by scientific panel\n* [(164)](https://ai-act-law.eu/recital/164/) Competencies of the AI Office\n\n[←Art. 74 AI Act](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/74/)\n[Art. 76 AI Act→](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/76/)\n[AI Act Table of contents](https://ai-act-law.eu)\n```",
