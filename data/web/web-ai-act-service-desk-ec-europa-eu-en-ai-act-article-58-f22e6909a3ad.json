Implementing acts will specify eligibility criteria, procedures, and terms for participation. Sandboxes will be open to all eligible providers, with transparent and fair selection processes. They will support flexibility, facilitate compliance with the AI Act, and involve various stakeholders. Procedures will be streamlined to encourage participation, especially for SMEs and start-ups. National competent authorities will also focus on developing tools for testing and assessing AI systems, with real-world testing subject to agreed safeguards.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n## Main Content\n\n### Chapter VI: Measures in Support of Innovation\n\n#### Article 58: Detailed Arrangements for, and Functioning of, AI Regulatory Sandboxes\n\n##### Summary\n\n1. In order to avoid fragmentation across the Union, the Commission shall adopt implementing acts specifying the detailed arrangements for the establishment, development, implementation, operation and supervision of the AI regulatory sandboxes. The implementing acts shall include common principles on the following issues:\n   - Eligibility and selection criteria for participation in the AI regulatory sandbox.\n   - Procedures for the application, participation, monitoring, exiting from and termination of the AI regulatory sandbox, including the sandbox plan and the exit report.\n   - The terms and conditions applicable to the participants.\n\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in [Article 98(2)](/en/ai-act/article-98).\n\n2. The implementing acts referred to in paragraph 1 shall ensure:\n   - That AI regulatory sandboxes are open to any applying provider or prospective provider of an AI system who fulfils eligibility and selection criteria, which shall be transparent and fair, and that national competent authorities inform applicants of their decision within three months of the application.\n   - That AI regulatory sandboxes allow broad and equal access and keep up with demand for participation; providers and prospective providers may also submit applications in partnerships with deployers and other relevant third parties.\n   - That the detailed arrangements for, and conditions concerning AI regulatory sandboxes support, to the best extent possible, flexibility for national competent authorities to establish and operate their AI regulatory sandboxes.\n   - That access to the AI regulatory sandboxes is free of charge for SMEs, including start-ups, without prejudice to exceptional costs that national competent authorities may recover in a fair and proportionate manner.\n   - That they facilitate providers and prospective providers, by means of the learning outcomes of the AI regulatory sandboxes, in complying with conformity assessment obligations under this Regulation and the voluntary application of the codes of conduct referred to in [Article 95](/en/ai-act/article-95).\n   - That AI regulatory sandboxes facilitate the involvement of other relevant actors within the AI ecosystem, such as notified bodies and standardisation organizations; SMEs; including start-ups; enterprises; innovators; testing and experimentation facilities; research laboratories; European Digital Innovation Hubs; centers of excellence; individual researchers; in order to allow and facilitate cooperation with the public sector or private sector.\n   - That procedures, processes and administrative requirements for application, selection, participation and exiting from an AI regulatory sandbox are simple,\n     easy to understand,\n     clearly communicated,\n     facilitating participation\n     particularly those participating\n     through limited legal capacity\n     administrative capacities\n     streamlined across Europe\n     avoid fragmentation\n     that participation is limited to a period appropriate to the complexity\n     scale of projects\n     may be extended by national competent authorities;\n   - That access to real-world testing supervised within an AI regulatory sandbox is available free-of-charge\n     SMEs including start-ups,\n     without prejudice to exceptional costs that national competent authorities may recover in a fair proportionate manner;\n   - That they facilitate development of tools\n     testing benchmarking assessing explaining dimensions\n     accuracy robustness cybersecurity,\n     measures mitigating risks fundamental rights society at large.\n\n3. Prospective providers in an AI regulatory sandbox should be directed where relevant towards pre-deployment services such as guidance on implementation of this Regulation towards other value-adding services such as help with standardization documents certification testing experimentation facilities European Digital Innovation Hubs centers of excellence.\n\n4. Where national competent authorities consider authorizing testing in real-world conditions supervised within an AI regulatory sandbox established under this Article they shall specifically agree terms conditions of such testing including appropriate safeguards with participants.\n\n### Relevant Recitals\n\n* [Recital 138](/en/ai-act/recital-138)\n* [Recital 139](/en/ai-act/recital-139)\n* [Recital 142](/en/ai-act/recital-142)\n* [Recital 143](/en/ai-act/recital-143)\n* [Recital 144](/en/ai-act/recital-144)\n* [Recital 145](/en/ai-act/recital-145)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).
