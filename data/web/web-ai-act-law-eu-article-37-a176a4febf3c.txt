### Introduction

1. The Commission shall, where necessary, investigate all cases where there are reasons to doubt the competence of a notified body or the continued fulfilment by a notified body of the requirements laid down in [Article 31](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/31/) and of its applicable responsibilities.
2. The notifying authority shall provide the Commission, on request, with all relevant information relating to the notification or the maintenance of the competence of the notified body concerned.
3. The Commission shall ensure that all sensitive information obtained in the course of its investigations pursuant to this Article is treated confidentially in accordance with [Article 78](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/78/).
4. **Note:** Where the Commission ascertains that a notified body does not meet or no longer meets the requirements for its notification, it shall inform the notifying Member State accordingly and request it to take the necessary corrective measures, including the suspension or withdrawal of the notification if necessary. However, this should not prevent any such action unless specifically requested by the Member State.
5. Where the Member State fails to take the necessary corrective measures, the Commission may, by means of an implementing act, suspend, restrict or withdraw the designation.
6. That implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in [Article 98(2)](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/98/).

### Cases Where Competence Doubt

The Commission must investigate every case raising doubts about either a notified body's competence or its ongoing fulfillment of required obligations under Articles 31 and their applicability.

---

### Information Provision Request

The Commission must receive all pertinent information regarding notifications made or updates maintained concerning each notification or maintenance of competence for a notified body.

---

### Suspension or Withdrawal Measures

If it becomes apparent that a notified body does not fulfill its obligations as outlined in Article 31, then:

- The Commission will notify both parties involved and initiate procedures for correction actions.
- If corrections are not made within a specified timeframe (not less than six months), further administrative sanctions may apply.
- In extreme circumstances, such as repeated violations or irreparable damage caused by these infractions, direct intervention through suspending designations might be warranted.

### Implementation Acts and Suspension Orders

Implementing acts related to suspension orders must be drafted according to a structured examination process defined in [Article 98(2)](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/98/).
