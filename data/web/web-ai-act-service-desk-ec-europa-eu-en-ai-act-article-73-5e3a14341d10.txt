## Summary

This article details the reporting requirements for serious incidents involving high-risk AI systems. Providers must report incidents to market surveillance authorities of the Member States where that incident occurred. The report referred to in paragraph 1 shall be made immediately after the provider has established a causal link between the AI system and the serious incident or the reasonable likelihood of such a link, and, in any event, not later than 15 days after the provider or, where applicable, the deployer becomes aware of the serious incident. The period for the reporting referred to in paragraph 1 shall take account of the severity of the serious incident.

The summary is meant to provide helpful explanation but is not legal binding.

## Article 73: Reporting of serious incidents

### Section 1: Reporting obligations

#### Paragraph 1
Providers of high-risk AI systems placed on the Union market shall report any serious incident to the market surveillance authorities of the Member States where that incident occurred.

#### Paragraph 2
The report referred to in paragraph 1 shall be made immediately after the provider has established a causal link between the AI system and the serious incident or the reasonable likelihood of such a link, and, in any event, not later than 15 days after the provider or, where applicable, the deployer becomes aware of the serious incident. The period for the reporting referred to in paragraph 1 shall take account of the severity of the serious incident.

**Note:** In cases of a widespread infringement or a serious incident as defined in [Article 3](/en/ai-act/article-3), point (49)(b), reports shall be provided immediately and not later than two days after becoming aware of it.

#### Paragraph 3
In cases where there is reason to believe that a widespread infringement or a serious incident as defined in [Article 3](/en/ai-act/article-3), point (49)(c), reports shall be provided immediately upon receipt by each relevant market surveillance authority.

#### Paragraph 4
If there is evidence indicating that death has resulted from using an AI system, reports shall be made immediately upon confirmation by either or both parties that an accident has occurred due to use of an AI system. Reports should be submitted within ten working days from when either party becomes aware that an accident has occurred due to use of an AI system.

#### Paragraph 5
Where necessary to ensure timely reporting, providers may submit an initial report that is incomplete before providing a complete one.

#### Paragraph 6
Following reporting, providers must investigate and assess any significant incidents. They must cooperate with competent authorities and notify them if required changes are made to their AI systems before submitting further documentation.

#### Paragraph 7
Market surveillance authorities must initiate appropriate measures within seven business days following notification and inform Commission about these actions within three months.

#### Paragraph 8
High-risk AI systems covered by other Union legislation can also be reported directly through mechanisms specified by those legislations.

#### Paragraph 9
For high-risk AI systems already placed on market or put into service under Union legislative instruments equivalent to those laid down in this Regulation, notifications must cover points (49)(c).

#### Paragraph 10
For safety components or devices covered by regulations (EU) 2017/745 and (EU) 2017/746, notifications must focus solely on points (49)(c) regarding high-risk AI systems.

### Section 2: Sharing information on serious incidents

National competent authorities must promptly notify Commission about any serious incident reported according to this Regulation. Notifications are expected within three months from receipt by each national competent authority.
