## Chapter III: High-Risk AI Systems

### Section 4: Notifying Authorities and Notified Bodies

#### Article 33: Subsidiaries of notified bodies and subcontracting

**Summary**

Notified bodies can subcontract tasks or use subsidiaries for conformity assessment but must ensure they meet the requirements of [Article 31](/en/ai-act/article-31) and inform the notifying authority. The notified body remains fully responsible for these tasks and must have the provider's agreement. They must keep relevant documents for five years and make a list of subsidiaries publicly available.

The summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.

1. Where a notified body subcontracts specific tasks connected with the conformity assessment or has recourse to a subsidiary, it shall ensure that the subcontractor or the subsidiary meets the requirements laid down in [Article 31](/en/ai-act/article-31), and shall inform the notifying authority accordingly.
2. Notified bodies shall take full responsibility for the tasks performed by any subcontractors or subsidiaries.
3. Activities may be subcontracted or carried out by a subsidiary only with the agreement of the provider. Notified bodies shall make a list of their subsidiaries publicly available.
4. The relevant documents concerning the assessment of the qualifications of the subcontractor or the subsidiary and the work carried out by them under this Regulation shall be kept at the disposal of the notifying authority for a period of five years from the termination date of the subcontracting.
