Therefore, prior to making their AI systems available in the Union, providers established in third countries should, by written mandate, appoint an authorised representative established in the Union. This authorised representative plays a pivotal role in ensuring the compliance of the high-risk AI systems placed on the market or put into service in the Union by those providers who are not established in the Union and in serving as their contact person established in the Union.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 16](/en/ai-act/article-16): Obligations of providers of high-risk AI systems\n*   [Article 22](/en/ai-act/article-22): Authorised representatives of providers of high-risk AI systems\n*   [Article 54](/en/ai-act/article-54): Authorised representatives of providers of general-purpose AI models\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).
