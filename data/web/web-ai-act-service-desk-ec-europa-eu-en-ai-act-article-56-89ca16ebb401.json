These codes aim to ensure compliance with the AI Act, covering issues like documentation, copyright policy, and systemic risk management including cybersecurity. The AI Office and the Board will involve various stakeholders, monitor the implementation, and evaluate the effectiveness of the codes. Providers can adhere to these codes to demonstrate compliance, and the AI Office will encourage their review and adaptation as needed.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n## Section 4: Codes of Practice\n\n### 1. The AI Office shall encourage and facilitate the drawing up of codes of practice at Union level in order to contribute to the proper application of this Regulation, taking into account international approaches.\n\n### 2. The AI Office and the Board shall aim to ensure that the codes of practice cover at least the obligations provided for in Articles 53 and 55, including the following issues:\n\n- (a) the means to ensure that the information referred to in [Article 53(1)](/en/ai-act/article-53), points (a) and (b), is kept up to date in light of market and technological developments;\n- (b) the adequate level of detail for the summary about the content used for training;\n- (c) the identification of the type and nature of the systemic risks at Union level, including their sources, where appropriate;\n- (d) the measures, procedures and modalities for the assessment and management of the systemic risks at Union level, including the documentation thereof, which shall be proportionate to the risks, take into consideration their severity and probability and take into account the specific challenges of tackling those risks in light of the possible ways in which such risks may emerge and materialise along the AI value chain.\n\n### 3. The AI Office may invite all providers of general-purpose AI models, as well as relevant national competent authorities, to participate in the drawing-up of codes of practice. Civil society organisations, industry, academia and other relevant stakeholders, such as downstream providers and independent experts, may support the process.\n\n### 4. The AI Office and the Board shall aim to ensure that the codes of practice clearly set out their specific objectives and contain commitments or measures, including key performance indicators as appropriate, to ensure the achievement of those objectives, and that they take due account of the needs and interests of all interested parties, including affected persons, at Union level.\n\n### 5. The AI Office shall aim to ensure that participants to the codes of practice report regularly to the AI Office on the implementation of the commitments and the measures taken and their outcomes, including as measured against the key performance indicators as appropriate. Key performance indicators and reporting commitments shall reflect differences in size and capacity between various participants.\n\n### 6. The AI Office and the Board shall regularly monitor and evaluate the achievement of the objectives of the codes of practice by the participants and their contribution to the proper application of this Regulation. The AI Office and the Board shall assess whether:\n   - (i) they cover all aspects required by Articles 53(1)(a)-(f).\n   - (ii) they address all relevant issues.\n   - (iii) they include sufficient details.\n   - (iv) they are proportionate.\n   - (v) they are clear.\n   - (vi) they are accessible.\n   - (vii) they consider both short-term goals as well as long-term impacts.\n   - (viii) they have been reviewed recently by a representative group.\n   - (ix) they have been tested through practical exercises or pilot projects.\n   - (x) they comply with applicable laws regarding transparency.\n   - (xi) there is a mechanism for seeking clarification on unclear provisions.\n   - (xii) there is a mechanism for obtaining explanations when faced with decisions made under these regulations.\n   - (xiii) there is a mechanism for requesting reports on how companies implement these regulations.\n   - (xiv)\n     * A list should be maintained containing names,\n     * Addresses,\n     * Contact details,\n     * Dates when each was last updated,\n     * An indication if any changes have occurred since then,\n     * A description indicating what has changed,\n     * A link leading directly back to them if possible,\n     * And links pointing towards documents related to them if possible.\n\nThe Commission may approve a code of practice by giving it a general validity within Europe. That implementing act must be adopted according to an examination procedure specified in [Article 98(2)](/en/ai-act/article-98).\n\n### 7. The AI Office may invite all providers of general-purpose AI models to adhere to these codes if no systemic risks are presented.\n\n### 8. The AI Office aims to ensure that these codes clearly outline their specific objectives while being suitable for different sizes based on capacity.\n\n### 9. Codes should be finalized by May 2nd 2025. If not finalized by August 2nd 2025 or deemed inadequate after evaluation under paragraph 6 due to lack or inadequacy after adoption under paragraph 7:\n- **If:** By October 1st 2025\n- **Otherwise:** By December 1st next year\nThe Commission can approve common rules for implementation without amendments under [Article 98(2)](/en/ai-act/article-98). This implementing act must also follow an examination procedure specified in [Article 98(2)](/en/ai-act/article-98).\n\n### Relevant Recitals\n\n* [Recital 116](/en/ai-act/recital-116)\n* [Recital 117](/en/ai-act/recital-117)\n* [Recital 135](/en/ai-act/recital-135)\n* [Recital 165](/en/ai-act/recital-165)\n\n### Other Resources\n\n[General-Purpose AI Code Of Practice](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/contents-code-gpai)\n\nView official text: [Artificial Intelligence Act Regulations](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689)\n```",
