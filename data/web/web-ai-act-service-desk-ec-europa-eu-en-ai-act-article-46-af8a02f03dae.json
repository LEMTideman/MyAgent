That authorisation shall be for a limited period while the necessary conformity assessment procedures are being carried out. In urgent situations, law enforcement or civil protection authorities may put high-risk AI systems into service without prior authorisation, but must request authorisation promptly.\n\nThe market surveillance authority is required to inform the Commission and other Member States of such authorisations. The authorisation is valid if the AI system complies with regulatory requirements and no objections are raised within 15 days. If objections are raised, the Commission will consult with the relevant Member State and operators to decide if the authorisation is justified. If deemed unjustified, the authorisation will be withdrawn. For AI systems covered by existing EU legislation listed in Section A of [Annex I](/en/ai-act/annex-1), only the derogations established in that legislation apply.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n#### Article 46: Derogation from conformity assessment procedure\n\n##### 1. By way of derogation from [Article 43](/en/ai-act/article-43) and upon a duly justified request, any market surveillance authority may authorise the placing on the market or the putting into service of specific high-risk AI systems within the territory of the Member State concerned, for exceptional reasons of public security or the protection of life and health of persons, environmental protection or the protection of key industrial and infrastructural assets. That authorisation shall be for a limited period while the necessary conformity assessment procedures are being carried out, taking into account the exceptional reasons justifying the derogation. The completion of those procedures shall be undertaken without undue delay.\n\n##### 2. In a duly justified situation of urgency for exceptional reasons of public security or in the case of specific, substantial and imminent threat to the life or physical safety of natural persons, law-enforcement authorities or civil protection authorities may put a specific high-risk AI system into service without the authorisation referred to in paragraph 1, provided that such authorisation is requested during or after the use without undue delay. If the authorisation referred to in paragraph 1 is refused, the use of the high-risk AI system shall be stopped with immediate effect and all the results and outputs of such use shall be immediately discarded.\n\n##### 3. The authorisation referred to in paragraph 1 shall be issued only if the market surveillance authority concludes that the high-risk AI system complies with the requirements of Section 2. The market surveillance authority shall inform the Commission and the other Member States of any authorisation issued pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2. This obligation shall not cover sensitive operational data in relation to activities related to law-enforcement authorities.\n\n##### 4. Where, within 15 calendar days of receipt of the information referred to in paragraph 3, no objection has been raised by either a Member State or the Commission in respect of an authorisation issued by a market surveillance authority of a Member State in accordance with paragraph 1, that authorisation shall be deemed justified.\n\n##### 5. Where, within 15 calendar days of receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph 3, objections are raised by a Member State against an authorisation issued by a market surveillance authority of another Member State, or where the Commission considers the authorisation to be contrary to Union law, or认为作者化是违反欧盟法律，或者市场监督机构的结论被认为不成立，则该批准将被取消。\n\n##### 6. Where there was consultation under paragraph 3 following receipt by either a member state or under paragraph&nbsp;2 following notification,&nbsp;objections were raised against an approval issued by a&nbsp;market&nbsp;surveillance&nbsp;authority&nbsp;of another member state,&nbsp;a decision should be made about whether it is justified.&nbsp;The Commission should address its decision to both affected states and operators involved.\n\n##### 7\\. For high-risk AI systems related to products covered by Union harmonization legislation listed in Section A of [Annex I](/en/ai-act/annex-1), only derogations from conformity assessment established in that harmonization legislation apply.\n\n### Relevant recitals\n*   [Recital 50](/en/ai-act/recital-50)\n*   [Recital 51](/en/ai-act/recital-51)\n*   [Recital 130](/en/ai-act/recital-130)\n\nView:\n[Official Text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689)\n```",
