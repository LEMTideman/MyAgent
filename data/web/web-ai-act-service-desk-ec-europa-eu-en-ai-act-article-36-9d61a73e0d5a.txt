# Article 36: Changes to notifications

## Summary

Notifying authorities must inform the Commission and other Member States of any changes to a notified body's status. If a notified body decides to stop its conformity assessment activities, it must inform the notifying authority and affected providers immediately, and, in case of planned cessation, at least one year before ceasing operations. The notified body's certificates can remain valid for nine months after it stops, provided another notified body agrees to take over responsibility for the high-risk AI systems. If a notified body no longer meets requirements, the notifying authority will investigate and may restrict, suspend, or withdraw its designation, informing the Commission and other Member States. The notified body must then inform providers within 10 days. The notifying authority will assess the impact on issued certificates, submit a report, and ensure that unduly issued certificates are suspended or withdrawn. Certificates remain valid under certain conditions during suspension, restriction, or withdrawal, with another notified body assuming responsibility if needed.

The summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.

## Section 4: Notifying Authorities and Notified Bodies

### Article 36: Changes to notifications

#### Summary

Notifying authorities must inform the Commission and the other Member States of any relevant changes to the notification of a notified body via the electronic notification tool referred to in [Article 30(2)](/en/ai-act/article-30).

#### Paragraphs

1. The notifying authority shall notify the Commission and the other Member States of any relevant changes to the notification of a notified body via the electronic notification tool referred to in [Article 30(2)](/en/ai-act/article-30).
   
2. The procedures laid down in Articles 29 and 30 shall apply to extensions of the scope of the notification.
   For changes to the notification other than extensions of its scope, the procedures laid down in paragraphs (3) to (9) shall apply.
   
3. Where a notified body decides to cease its conformity assessment activities, it shall inform the notifying authority and the providers concerned as soon as possible and, in the case of a planned cessation, at least one year before ceasing its activities. The certificates of the notified body may remain valid for a period of nine months after cessation of the notified body’s activities, on condition that another notified body has confirmed in writing that it will assume responsibilities for the high-risk AI systems covered by those certificates. The latter notified body shall complete a full assessment of the high-risk AI systems affected by the end of that nine-month-period before issuing new certificates for those systems. Where the notified body has ceased its activity, the notifying authority shall withdraw the designation.
   
4. Where a notifying authority has sufficient reason to consider that a notified body no longer meets the requirements laid down in [Article 31](/en/ai-act/article-31), or that it is failing to fulfill its obligations, the notifying authority shall without delay investigate the matter with utmost diligence. In that context, it shall inform the notified body concerned about the objections raised and give it the possibility to make its views known. If the notifying authority comes to conclude that:
   - (a) The notified body no longer meets requirements laid down in [Article 31](/en/ai-act/article-31) or fails to fulfill obligations.
   - (b) There is no risk to health, safety or fundamental rights associated with certificates affected by suspension or restriction.
   - (c) Another qualified notified body assumes immediate responsibility for high-risk AI systems covered by certificates affected by suspension or restriction.
   Then:
   - (i) It assesses impact on issued certificates;
   - (ii) It submits report on findings within three months;
   - (iii) It requires certified bodies whose unduly issued certificates need correction;
   - (iv) It informs Commission and Member States about certificates requiring suspension or withdrawal;
   - (v) It provides national competent authorities with information about certificates affected by suspension or withdrawal.
   
5. Where its designation has been suspended, restricted, or fully or partially withdrawn,通知体（Notifyee）应立即通知委内瑞拉和其它成员国。委内瑞拉应迅速调查并确定是否需要暂停、限制或撤销其编号，必要时采取相应行动。
6. 在终止或被禁用的决定中，通知体（Notifyee）应及时告知委内瑞拉和提供服务的提供商，并在计划停止运营至少一年后立即进行此操作。如果委托人希望提前结束业务，则应在停止运营之前一个月提出申请。证书将保留九个月，前提是另一通知机构同意承担高风险人工智能系统的责任。如果通知机构不再满足要求，它将审查情况并评估对证书的影响，提交报告，并确保未违规发出的证书不会继续发布。证书的有效期将在恢复运作期间延长至最多三年。
7. 委员会可随时检查通知机构及其提供的服务的质量与合规性。
