A general description of the general-purpose AI model including:\n   - The tasks that the model is intended to perform and the type and nature of AI systems into which it can be integrated;\n   - The acceptable use policies applicable;\n   - The date of release and methods of distribution;\n   - How the model interacts, or can be used to interact, with hardware or software that is not part of the model itself, where applicable;\n   - The versions of relevant software related to the use of the general-purpose AI model, where applicable;\n   - The architecture and number of parameters;\n   - The modality (e.g., text, image) and format of inputs and outputs;\n   - The license for the model.\n\n2. A description of the elements of the model and of the process for its development, including:\n   - The technical means (e.g., instructions for use, infrastructure, tools) required for the general-purpose AI model to be integrated into AI systems;\n   - The modality (e.g., text, image, etc.) and format of the inputs and outputs and their maximum size (e.g., context window length, etc.);\n   - Information on the data used for training, testing, and validation, where applicable, including the type and provenance of data and curation methodologies.\n\n## Elements Used in Development\n\n1. A description of how to integrate a general-purpose AI model into other AI systems using appropriate technologies.\n2. An outline of processes involved in developing a general-purpose AI model from raw data.\n3. Details about curating datasets used during development.\n4. Information on licensing agreements associated with a general-purpose AI model.\n\n---\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).
