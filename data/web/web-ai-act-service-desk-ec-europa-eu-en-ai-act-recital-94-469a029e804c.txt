# Recital 94

Any processing of biometric data involved in the use of AI systems for biometric identification for the purpose of law enforcement needs to comply with [Article 10](/en/ai-act/article-10) of Directive (EU) 2016/680, that allows such processing only where strictly necessary, subject to appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data subject, and where authorised by Union or Member State law. Such use, when authorised, also needs to respect the principles laid down in [Article 4 (1)](/en/ai-act/article-4) of Directive (EU) 2016/680 including lawfulness, fairness and transparency, purpose limitation, accuracy and storage limitation.
