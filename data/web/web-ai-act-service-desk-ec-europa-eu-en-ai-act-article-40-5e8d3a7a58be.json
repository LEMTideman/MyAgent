The standardisation request shall also ask for deliverables on reporting and documentation processes to improve AI systems’ resource performance, such as reducing the high-risk AI system’s consumption of energy and of other resources during its lifecycle, and on the energy-efficient development of general-purpose AI models. When preparing a standardisation request, the Commission shall consult the Board and relevant stakeholders, including the advisory forum.\n\nWhen issuing a standardisation request to European standardisation organisations, the Commission shall specify that standards have to be clear, consistent, including with the standards developed in the various sectors for products covered by the existing Union harmonisation legislation listed in [Annex I](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-1), and aiming to ensure that high-risk AI systems or general-purpose AI models placed on the market or put into service in the Union meet the relevant requirements or obligations laid down in this Regulation.\n\nThe Commission shall request the European standardisation organisations to provide evidence of their best efforts to fulfil the objectives referred to in the first and second subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with [Article 24](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-24) of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012.\n\n### Relevant recitals\n\n*   [Recital 117](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-117)\n*   [Recital 121](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/recital-121)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).
