# Recital 124

## Overview

It is appropriate that, in order to minimise the burden on operators and avoid any possible duplication, for high-risk AI systems related to products which are covered by existing Union harmonisation legislation based on the New Legislative Framework, the compliance of those AI systems with the requirements of this Regulation should be assessed as part of the conformity assessment already provided for in that law. The applicability of the requirements of this Regulation should thus not affect the specific logic, methodology or general structure of conformity assessment under the relevant Union harmonisation legislation.

### This Recital relates to

*   [Article 34: Operational obligations of notified bodies](/en/ai-act/article-34)
*   [Article 43: Conformity assessment](/en/ai-act/article-43)
