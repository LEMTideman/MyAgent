# Article 3: Definitions

## Summary

[Article 3](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-3) of the AI Act provides definitions for terms used throughout the AI Act.

The summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.

### Definition 1: 'AI system'

**Definition:** A machine-based system that operates with varying levels of autonomy and exhibits adaptiveness after deployment, generating outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions influenced by input.

### Definition 2: 'Risk'

**Definition:** The combination of the probability of an occurrence of harm and its severity.

### Definition 3: 'Provider'

**Definition:** Natural or legal persons, public authorities, agencies, or other bodies that develop an AI system or a general-purpose AI model and place them on the market or put them into service under their own name or trademark.

### Definition 4: 'Deployer'

**Definition:** Natural or legal persons, public authorities, agencies, or other bodies using an AI system under their authority except where the AI system is used in the course of a personal non-professional activity.

### Definition 5: 'Authorised Representative'

**Definition:** Natural or legal persons located or established in the Union receiving and accepting a written mandate from a provider of an AI system or a general-purpose AI model to perform and carry out obligations and procedures established by this Regulation.

### Definition 6: 'Importer'

**Definition:** Natural or legal persons located or established in the Union importing an AI system bearing the name or trademark of a natural or legal person established in a third country.

### Definition 7: 'Distributor'

**Definition:** Natural or legal persons in the supply chain offering an AI system on the Union market.

### Definition 8: 'Operator'

**Definition:** Providers, manufacturers, deployers, authorised representatives, importers, and distributors.

### Definition 9: 'Placing on the Market'

**Definition:** First making available of an AI system or a general-purpose AI model on the Union market.

### Definition 10: 'Making Available on the Market'

**Definition:** Supplying an AI system for distribution or use on the Union market in return for payment or free of charge.

### Definition 11: 'Putting into Service'

**Definition:** Supplying an AI system for first use directly to a deployer or for own use within the Union for its intended purpose.

### Definition 12: 'Intended Purpose'

**Definition:** Use for which an AI system is intended by its provider, including specific contexts and conditions of use specified in instructions for use, promotional materials, and technical documentation.

### Definition 13: 'Reasonably Foreseeable Misuse'

**Definition:** Use of an AI system beyond its intended purpose that may result from reasonable human behavior interactions with other systems.

### Definition 14: 'Safety Component’

**Definition:** Component within a product or AI system fulfilling safety functions for that product or model. Failure leading to danger threatens health and safety of humans and/or property.

### Definition 15: 'Instructions for Use’

**Definition:** Information provided by the provider informing deployers about the intended purpose and proper use of an AI system.

### Definition 16: 'Recall of an AI System’

**Definition:** Any measure aimed at returning a provider's product to their original state before it was placed on sale. It includes disassembling products if feasible while ensuring no further damage occurs during removal processes.

### Definition 17: 'Withdrawal of an AI System’

**Definition:** Preventing an already placed product from being made available again on sale by removing it from circulation. This involves stopping production operations associated with selling products once they are sold off-market services are discontinued. If there is no longer demand for these services then withdrawal can be considered complete since no new orders will be processed anymore. However if there remains some residual demand for these services then withdrawal cannot be considered complete yet until all remaining orders have been fulfilled. For example if there is still ongoing maintenance work required even though all customers have completed their contracts so long as those contracts remain intact then withdrawal cannot be considered complete yet until all maintenance work has been completed. Similarly if there is still ongoing marketing work required even though all customers have completed their contracts so long as those contracts remain intact then withdrawal cannot be considered complete yet until all marketing work has been completed. Therefore withdrawal can only be considered complete once all ongoing maintenance work has been completed. Once withdrawn from sale it must not be resold again anywhere else in Europe because it has lost its status as compliant with EU law regarding compliance with EU regulations governing compliance assessments etc., hence it must never be rebranded nor marketed under any guise whatsoever just because it was previously branded under another company's name(s).

### Definition 18: 'Performance of an AI System’

**Definition:** Ability to achieve its intended purpose without causing harm to people (including physical injury), property loss (such as destruction), environmental degradation (such as pollution), financial losses (such as loss of income), reputational damages (such as loss of brand recognition), privacy violations (such as unauthorized collection), discrimination (such as unfair treatment based solely on race/color/gender/disability/etc.), harassment (such as offensive comments), exploitation (of vulnerable populations like
