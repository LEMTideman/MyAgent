They must come with clear, comprehensive instructions that include provider contact details, system characteristics, capabilities and limitations of performance. The information provided should include, inter alia, intended purpose, the level of accuracy, robustness, cybersecurity, and potential risks. Instructions should also detail human oversight measures, computational and hardware requirements, maintenance needs, and logging mechanisms to ensure proper functioning and compliance.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n#### Relevant Recitals\n- [Recital 27](/en/ai-act/recital-27)\n- [Recital 59](/en/ai-act/recital-59)\n- [Recital 60](/en/ai-act/recital-60)\n- [Recital 66](/en/ai-act/recital-66)\n- [Recital 67](/en/ai-act/recital-67)\n- [Recital 71](/en/ai-act/recital-71)\n- [Recital 72](/en/ai-act/recital-72)\n- [Recital 74](/en/ai-act/recital-74)\n- [Recital 104](/en/ai-act/recital-104)\n- [Recital 107](/en/ai-act/recialtioal-t107)\n- [Recital 131](/en/ai-tacit-recialtioal-t131)\n-\n```",
