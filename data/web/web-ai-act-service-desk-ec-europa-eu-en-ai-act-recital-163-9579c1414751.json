  "text": "```markdown\n# Recital 163\n\n## With a view to complementing the governance systems for general-purpose AI models, the scientific panel should support the monitoring activities of the AI Office and may, in certain cases, provide qualified alerts to the AI Office which trigger follow-ups, such as investigations. This should be the case where the scientific panel has reason to suspect that a general-purpose AI model poses a concrete and identifiable risk at Union level. Furthermore, this should be the case where the scientific panel has reason to suspect that a general-purpose AI model meets the criteria that would lead to a classification as general-purpose AI model with systemic risk. To equip the scientific panel with the information necessary for the performance of those tasks, there should be a mechanism whereby the scientific panel can request the Commission to require documentation or information from a provider.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 51: Classification of general-purpose AI models as general-purpose AI models with systemic risk](/en/ai-act/article-51)\n*   [Article 69: Access to the pool of experts by the Member States](/en/ai-act/article-69)\n*   [Article 90: Alerts of systemic risks by the scientific panel](/en/ai-act/article-90)\n\n---\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).
