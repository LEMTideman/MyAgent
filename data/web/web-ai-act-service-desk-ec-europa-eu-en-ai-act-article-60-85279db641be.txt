# Article 60: Testing of high-risk AI systems in real world conditions outside AI regulatory sandboxes

## Summary

The article outlines the conditions for testing high-risk AI systems listed in [Annex III](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-3) in real-world settings outside of AI regulatory sandboxes. Providers must submit a testing plan to market surveillance authorities for approval and register the testing. Key conditions include data protection, informed consent, oversight by qualified personnel, and the ability to reverse AI decisions. Testing is limited to six months, extendable once, and must not negatively affect vulnerable groups. Authorities can inspect and ensure safe testing, and providers must report serious incidents and adopt mitigation measures or suspend or terminate the testing. Providers are also liable for any damages.

The summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.
