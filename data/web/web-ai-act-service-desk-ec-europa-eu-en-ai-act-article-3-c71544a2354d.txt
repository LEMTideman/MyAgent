# Article 3: Definitions

## Summary

[Article 3](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-3) of the AI Act provides definitions for terms used throughout the AI Act.

The summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.

### Definition 1: 'AI system'

**Definition:** A machine-based system that is designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy and that may exhibit adaptiveness after deployment, and that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments.

### Definition 2: 'Risk'

**Definition:** The combination of the probability of an occurrence of harm and the severity of that harm.

### Definition 3: 'Provider'

**Definition:** A natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body that develops an AI system or a general-purpose AI model or that has an AI system or a general-purpose AI model developed and places it on the market or puts the AI system into service under its own name or trademark, whether for payment or free of charge.

### Definition 4: 'Deployer'

**Definition:** A natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body using an AI system under its authority except where the AI system is used in the course of a personal non-professional activity.

### Definition 5: 'Authorised Representative'

**Definition:** A natural or legal person located or established in the Union who has received and accepted a written mandate from a provider of an AI system or a general-purpose AI model to perform and carry out on its behalf the obligations and procedures established by this Regulation.

### Definition 6: 'Importer'

**Definition:** A natural or legal person located or established in the Union that places on the market an AI system that bears the name or trademark of a natural or legal person established in a third country.

### Definition 7: 'Distributor'

**Definition:** A natural or legal person in the supply chain, other than the provider or the importer, that makes an AI system available on the Union market.

### Definition 8: 'Operator'

**Definition:** A provider, product manufacturer, deployer, authorised representative, importer or distributor.

### Definition 9: 'Placing on the Market'

**Definition:** The first making available of an AI system or a general-purpose AI model on the Union market.

### Definition 10: 'Making Available on the Market'

**Definition:** The supply of an AI system or a general-purpose AI model for distribution or use on the Union market in the course of a commercial activity, whether in return for payment or free of charge.

### Definition 11: 'Putting into Service'

**Definition:** The supply of an AI system for first use directly to the deployer or for own use in the Union for its intended purpose.

### Definition 12: 'Intended Purpose'

**Definition:** The use for which an AI系统是设计的，包括预期的使用场景和条件。

### Definition 13: 'Reasonably Foreseeable Misuse’

**Definition**: Use of an AI system in a way that is not in accordance with its intended purpose but may result from reasonably foreseeable human behavior or interactions with other systems, including other AI systems.

### Definition 14: 'Safety Component’

**Definition**: A component of a product (or general-purpose AI model) which fulfills a safety function for that product (or general-purpose AI model), ensuring it meets basic safety needs. Failure in these functions can lead to serious health and safety consequences.

### Definition 15: ‘Instructions for Use’

**Definition**: Information provided by the provider to inform users about what an AI system's intended purpose is and proper usage methods.

### Definition 16: ‘Recall of an AI System’

**Definition**: Any measure aimed at achieving immediate removal from service if needed due to concerns regarding compliance with required requirements set out in Chapter III Section 2.

### Definition 17: ‘Withdrawal of an AI System’

**Definition**: Any measure aimed at preventing further availability if there is no longer intent to continue using it within its original context.

### Definition 18: ‘Performance of an AI System’

**Definition**: Ability to achieve its intended purpose effectively without causing unintended side effects like malfunctions (failure).

### Definition 19: ‘Notifying Authority’

**Definition**: National authority responsible for setting up and implementing necessary procedures for assessing conformity assessment bodies and monitoring them according to relevant Union harmonization legislation.

### Definition 20: ‘Conformity Assessment’

**Definition**: Process demonstrating whether requirements set out in Chapter III Section 2 relating to high-risk systems have been fulfilled. This includes testing services (certification), inspections etc., performed by third parties certified under this regulation and other relevant harmonized legislation providing means to comply with certain requirements established under this Regulation.

### Definition 21: ‘Conformity Assessment Body’

**Definition**: Third-party organization conducting tests related to conformity assessments. It must meet specific criteria outlined in Directive (EU) No. 2014/90/EU and Directive (EU) No. 2016/797 concerning artificial intelligence systems as defined hereunder. These organizations must be notified via Annex III before they can begin testing activities under this Regulation and other relevant harmonization legislation provisions requiring their registration status. They must also maintain confidentiality agreements with those involved in their testing activities while they are engaged in such activities. There are some exceptions where they can share confidential information among themselves without violating privacy laws because they are working together with another entity authorized by law to perform similar functions. They cannot disclose sensitive operational data unless specifically requested by law enforcement authorities acting within their jurisdictional limits. They should also ensure adequate safeguards against unauthorized access to protected data during testing activities conducted outside regulated areas like laboratories but outside real-world conditions where data collection occurs remotely without significant delays so as not to compromise investigations into crimes punishable by criminal sanctions. For example:

* **Remote Biometric Identification Systems**
* **Real-Time Remote Biometric Identification Systems**

These types include remote biometric identification systems where all steps occur without significant delays like instant identification combined with minimal short-term delays aimed at avoiding circumvention issues due to potential threats posed by criminals seeking evasion tactics when investigating crimes punishable by criminal sanctions. Real-time remote biometric identification systems require instant identification followed by minimal short-term delays rather than long-term delays associated with traditional laboratory-based approaches focusing solely on detecting suspicious patterns indicative of malicious activity prior to confirmation through additional checks beyond mere visual comparisons between captured biometrics from subjects compared against stored reference databases containing biometric profiles derived from previous participants participating voluntarily within controlled settings known as "sandbox plans". These types involve multiple stages starting with rapid identification followed by brief periods allowing investigators examining evidence gathered earlier during pre-testing phases conducted elsewhere away from typical operating environments often situated indoors near computer terminals connected online networks potentially facilitating illicit transactions facilitated through sophisticated techniques exploiting vulnerabilities inherent within digital ecosystems susceptible only when exploited successfully once identified accurately enough enabling successful deception leading ultimately towards financial gains achievable only through manipulation deceive others thereby evading justice thus posing severe threat undermining trust among citizens necessitating swift
