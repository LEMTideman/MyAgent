  "text": "```markdown\n# Recital 138\n\n## Overview\n\nAI is a rapidly developing family of technologies that requires regulatory oversight and a safe and controlled space for experimentation, while ensuring responsible innovation and integration of appropriate safeguards and risk mitigation measures. To ensure a legal framework that promotes innovation, is future-proof and resilient to disruption, Member States should ensure that their national competent authorities establish at least one AI regulatory sandbox at national level to facilitate the development and testing of innovative AI systems under strict regulatory oversight before these systems are placed on the market or otherwise put into service. Member States could also fulfil this obligation through participating in already existing regulatory sandboxes or establishing jointly a sandbox with one or more Member States’ competent authorities, insofar as this participation provides equivalent level of national coverage for the participating Member States. AI regulatory sandboxes could be established in physical, digital or hybrid form and may accommodate physical as well as digital products. Establishing authorities should also ensure that the AI regulatory sandboxes have the adequate resources for their functioning, including financial and human resources.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 57: AI regulatory sandboxes](/en/ai-act/article-57)\n*   [Article 58: Detailed arrangements for, and functioning of, AI regulatory sandboxes](/en/ai-act/article-58)\n*   [Article 59: Further processing of personal data for developing certain AI systems in the public interest in the AI regulatory sandbox](/en/ai-act/article-59)\n\n---\n\n## Contact Us\n\n*   [Contact the AI Office](mailto:CNECT-AIOFFICE@ec.europa.eu)\n\n---\n\n## About Us\n\n*   [Copyright notice](/en/copyright-notice)\n*   [Legal notice](/en/legal-notice)\n*   [Privacy statement](/en/privacy-statement-ai-act-service-desk-website)\n*   [About Directorate-General CONNECT](https://commission.europa.eu/about-departments-and-executive-agencies/communications-networks-content-and-technology_en)\n\n---\n\n## Additional Links\n\n[Contact the European Commission](https://commission.europa.eu/about-european-commission/contact_en)\n\n[Follow the European Commission on social media](https://european-union.europa.eu/contact-eu/social-media-channels_en#/search?page=0&institutions=european_commission)\n\n[Resources for partners](https://commission.europa.eu/resources-partners_en)\n\n[Report an IT vulnerability](https://commission.europa.eu/legal-notice/vulnerability-disclosure-policy_en)\n\n[Languages on our websites](https://commission.europa.eu/languages-our-websites_en)\n\n[Cookies](https://commission.europa.eu/cookies_en)\n\n[Privacy policy](https://commission.europa.eu/privacy-policy_en)\n\n[Legal notice](https://commission.europa.eu/legal-notice_en)\n```",
