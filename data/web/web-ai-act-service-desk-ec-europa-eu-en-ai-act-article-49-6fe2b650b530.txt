# Article 49: Registration

## Summary

The article outlines the registration requirements for high-risk AI systems before they are placed on the market or put into service. Providers must register themselves and their systems in the EU database, except for certain systems listed in [Annex III](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-3) used in the area of critical infrastructure. Public authorities and related entities must also register when deploying high-risk AI systems. Specific high-risk AI systems used in areas of law enforcement, migration, asylum and border control management must be registered in a secure, non-public section of the EU database. Certain high-risk AI systems used in the area of critical infrastructure are registered at the national level.

The summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.
