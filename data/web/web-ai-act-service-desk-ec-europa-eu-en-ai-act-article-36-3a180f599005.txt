# Article 36: Changes to notifications

## Summary

Notifying authorities must inform the Commission and other Member States of any changes to a notified body's status. If a notified body decides to stop its conformity assessment activities, it must inform the notifying authority and affected providers immediately, and, in case of planned cessation, at least one year before ceasing operations. The notified body's certificates can remain valid for nine months after it stops, provided another notified body agrees to take over responsibility for the high-risk AI systems. If a notified body no longer meets requirements, the notifying authority will investigate and may restrict, suspend, or withdraw its designation, informing the Commission and other Member States. The notified body must then inform providers within 10 days. The notifying authority will assess the impact on issued certificates, submit a report, and ensure that unduly issued certificates are suspended or withdrawn. Certificates remain valid under certain conditions during suspension, restriction, or withdrawal, with another notified body assuming responsibility if needed.

The summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.

## Section 4: Notifying Authorities and Notified Bodies

### Article 36: Changes to notifications

#### Summary

Notifying authorities must inform the Commission and the other Member States of any relevant changes to the notification of a notified body via the electronic notification tool referred to in [Article 30(2)](/en/ai-act/article-30).

#### Paragraphs

1. The notifying authority shall notify the Commission and the other Member States of any relevant changes to the notification of a notified body via the electronic notification tool referred to in [Article 30(2)](/en/ai-act/article-30).
   
2. The procedures laid down in Articles 29 and 30 shall apply to extensions of the scope of the notification.
   For changes to the notification other than extensions of its scope, the procedures laid down in paragraphs (3) to (9) shall apply.
   
3. Where a notified body decides to cease its conformity assessment activities, it shall inform the notifying authority and the providers concerned as soon as possible and, in the case of a planned cessation, at least one year before ceasing its activities. The certificates of the notified body may remain valid for a period of nine months after cessation of the notified body’s activities, on condition that another notified body has confirmed in writing that it will assume responsibilities for the high-risk AI systems covered by those certificates. The latter notified body shall complete a full assessment of the high-risk AI systems affected by the end of that nine-month-period before issuing new certificates for those systems. Where the notified body has ceased its activity, the notifying authority shall withdraw the designation.
   
4. Where a notifying authority has sufficient reason to consider that a notified body no longer meets the requirements laid down in [Article 31](/en/ai-act/article-31), or that it is failing to fulfill its obligations, the notifying authority shall without delay investigate the matter with utmost diligence. In that context, it shall inform the notified body concerned about the objections raised and give it the possibility to make its views known. If the notifying authority comes to conclude that:
   - (a) The notified body no longer meets requirements laid down in [Article 31](/en/ai-act/article-31) or fails to fulfill obligations.
   - (b) There is no risk to health, safety or fundamental rights associated with certificates affected by suspension or restriction.
   - (c) Another qualified notified body assumes immediate responsibility for high-risk AI systems covered by those certificates.
   Then:
   - (d) Assess impact on issued certificates.
   - (e) Submit report on findings within three months.
   - (f) Require certified bodies whose issuance was unduly influenced by suspension or restriction be suspended or withdrawn promptly.
   - (g) Inform Commission and Member States about certificate suspensions or withdrawals.
   - (h) Provide national competent authorities with information about affected certifications regarding certificates suspended or withdrawn.

5. Where its designation has been suspended, restricted, or fully or partially withdrawn,通知体（Notifyee）应立即通知其提供方，以确保文件保留并使它们可供其他成员国和市场监督机构使用。
6. 在暂停、限制或撤销通知的情况下，通知体应采取适当的步骤来确保文件的保存，并在必要时避免潜在对健康、安全或基本权利的风险。

7. 如果通知体决定停止其认证评估活动，则应及时告知通知员和受影响的提供者。如果计划终止，应在至少一年前告知通知员。
8. 当暂停、限制或撤销通知时，通知员将进行调查并尽快确认是否需要纠正措施。如果认为通知体不再符合要求或未能履行义务，则有权对其进行限制、暂停或撤消指定。
9. 若通知员有充分理由怀疑通知体不再满足要求或未履行义务，则无需等待进一步报告即可进行调查。在此期间，通知员应向被通知体提出异议，并给予机会做出回应。若发现任何问题，通知员可采取相应行动：
   - (a) 调查影响证书的影响。
   - (b) 提交一份报告，说明其发现及建议采取的具体行动时间表。
   - (c) 要求被通知体在三个月内提交另一家合格的通知员负责该高风险人工智能系统的证明材料。
10. 在暂停、限制或撤销指定后，证书的有效期为九个月，在此期间：
    - (a) 告知委任人有关证书中可能存在的风险。
    - (b) 其他合格的通知人在书面形式上表示他们将在规定时间内承担相关证书的责任。
