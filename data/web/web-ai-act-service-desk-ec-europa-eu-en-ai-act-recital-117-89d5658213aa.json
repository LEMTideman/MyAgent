  "text": "```markdown\n# Recital 117\n\nThe codes of practice should represent a central tool for the proper compliance with the obligations provided for under this Regulation for providers of general-purpose AI models. Providers should be able to rely on codes of practice to demonstrate compliance with the obligations. By means of implementing acts, the Commission may decide to approve a code of practice and give it a general validity within the Union, or, alternatively, to provide common rules for the implementation of the relevant obligations, if, by the time this Regulation becomes applicable, a code of practice cannot be finalised or is not deemed adequate by the AI Office. Once a harmonised standard is published and assessed as suitable to cover the relevant obligations by the AI Office, compliance with a European harmonised standard should grant providers the presumption of conformity. Providers of general-purpose AI models should furthermore be able to demonstrate compliance using alternative adequate means, if codes of practice or harmonised standards are not available, or they choose not to rely on those.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 16: Obligations of providers of high-risk AI systems](/en/ai-act/article-16)\n*   [Article 32: Presumption of conformity with requirements relating to notified bodies](/en/ai-act/article-32)\n*   [Article 40: Harmonised standards and standardisation deliverables](/en/ai-act/article-40)\n*   [Article 56: Codes of practice](/en/ai-act/article-56)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).
