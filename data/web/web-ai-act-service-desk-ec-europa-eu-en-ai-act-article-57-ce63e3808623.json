These sandboxes provide a controlled environment for developing and testing innovative AI systems before market release. They aim to improve legal certainty, foster innovation, and support regulatory compliance. Competent authorities will offer guidance and supervision, and providers can use sandbox activities to demonstrate compliance. Authorities must inform the AI Office about sandbox establishments and submit annual reports on progress and outcomes.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n1. Member States shall ensure that their competent authorities establish at least one AI regulatory sandbox at national level, which shall be operational by 2 August 2026. That sandbox may also be established jointly with the competent authorities of other Member States. The Commission may provide technical support, advice and tools for the establishment and operation of AI regulatory sandboxes.\n\n   The obligation under the first subparagraph may also be fulfilled by participating in an existing sandbox in so far as that participation provides an equivalent level of national coverage for the participating Member States.\n\n2. Additional AI regulatory sandboxes at regional or local level, or established jointly with the competent authorities of other Member States may also be established.\n\n3. The European Data Protection Supervisor may also establish an AI regulatory sandbox for Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, and may exercise the roles and the tasks of national competent authorities in accordance with this Chapter.\n\n4. Member States shall ensure that the competent authorities referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 allocate sufficient resources to comply with this Article effectively and in a timely manner. Where appropriate, national competent authorities shall cooperate with other relevant authorities, and may allow for the involvement of other actors within the AI ecosystem. This Article shall not affect other regulatory sandboxes established under Union or national law. Member States shall ensure an appropriate level of cooperation between the authorities supervising those other sandboxes and the national competent authorities.\n\n5. AI regulatory sandboxes established under paragraph 1 shall provide for a controlled environment that fosters innovation and facilitates the development, training, testing and validation of innovative AI systems for a limited time before their being placed on the market or put into service pursuant to a specific sandbox plan agreed between the providers or prospective providers and the competent authority. Such sandboxes may include testing in real world conditions supervised therein.\n\n6. Competent authorities shall provide, as appropriate, guidance, supervision and support within the AI regulatory sandbox with a view to identifying risks, in particular to fundamental rights, health and safety, testing, mitigation measures, and their effectiveness in relation to the obligations and requirements of this Regulation and, where relevant, other Union and national law supervised within the sandbox.\n\n7. Competent authorities shall provide providers and prospective providers participating in the AI regulatory sandbox with guidance on regulatory expectations and how to fulfill the requirements and obligations set out in this Regulation.\n\n   Upon request of the provider or prospective provider of the AI system, the competent authority shall provide a written proof of the activities successfully carried out in the sandbox. The competent authority shall also provide an exit report detailing the activities carried out in the sandbox and related results and learning outcomes. Providers may use such documentation to demonstrate their compliance with this Regulation through the conformity assessment process or relevant market surveillance activities. In this regard, the exit reports and written proof provided by the national competent authority shall be taken positively into account by market surveillance authorities and notified bodies, with a view to accelerating conformity assessment procedures to a reasonable extent.\n\n8. Subject to the confidentiality provisions in [Article 78](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-78), and with the agreement of the provider or prospective provider, the Commission and the Board shall be authorized to access exit reports and take them into account as appropriate when exercising their tasks under this Regulation. If both parties agree,\n   \n   - **A**: Improving legal certainty to achieve regulatory compliance with this Regulation or,\n   - **B**: Supporting collaboration among different entities involved in regulating these regulations.\n   \n   - **C**: Facilitating evidence-based regulation learning.\n   \n   - **D**: Contributing to efficient access to markets for artificial intelligence products/services involving personal data processing.\n   \n9. National competent authorities shall ensure that,\n   \n   - **E**: Personal data processing involves processing personal data falling under supervisory responsibilities held by other national or competent authorities.\n   \n   - **F:** Processing is subject to privacy legislation.\n   \n10\\. National competent authorities shall ensure that,\n   \n    - **G:** Cross-border cooperation is facilitated between national competent authorities.\n    \n11\\. National competent authorities shall coordinate their activities\n```",
