  "text": "```markdown\n# Recital 122\n\n## Overview\n\nIt is appropriate that, without prejudice to the use of harmonised standards and common specifications, providers of a high-risk AI system that has been trained and tested on data reflecting the specific geographical, behavioural, contextual or functional setting within which the AI system is intended to be used, should be presumed to comply with the relevant measure provided for under the requirement on data governance set out in this Regulation. Without prejudice to the requirements related to robustness and accuracy set out in this Regulation, in accordance with [Article 54(3)](/en/ai-act/article-54) of Regulation (EU) 2019/881, high-risk AI systems that have been certified or for which a statement of conformity has been issued under a cybersecurity scheme pursuant to that Regulation and the references of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union should be presumed to comply with the cybersecurity requirement of this Regulation in so far as the cybersecurity certificate or statement of conformity or parts thereof cover the cybersecurity requirement of this Regulation. This remains without prejudice to the voluntary nature of that cybersecurity scheme.\n\n### Related Articles\n\n*   [Article 41: Common specifications](/en/ai-act/article-41)\n*   [Article 42: Presumption of conformity with certain requirements](/en/ai-act/article-42)\n\n---\n\n## Contact Us\n\n*   **Email:** [CNECT-AIOFFICE@ec.europa.eu](mailto:CNECT-AIOFFICE@ec.europa.eu)\n\n---\n\n## About Us\n\n*   [Copyright notice](/en/copyright-notice)\n*   [Legal notice](/en/legal-notice)\n*   [Privacy statement](/en/privacy-statement-ai-act-service-desk-website)\n*   [About Directorate-General CONNECT](https://commission.europa.eu/about-departments-and-executive-agencies/communications-networks-content-and-technology_en)\n\n---\n\n## Additional Links\n\n*   [Contact the European Commission](https://commission.europa.eu/about-european-commission/contact_en)\n*   [Follow the European Commission on social media](https://european-union.europa.eu/contact-eu/social-media-channels_en#/search?page=0&institutions=european_commission)\n*   [Resources for partners](https://commission.europa.eu/resources-partners_en)\n*   [Report an IT vulnerability](https://commission.europa.eu/legal-notice/vulnerability-disclosure-policy_en)\n\n---\n\n## Legal Notices\n\n*   [Languages on our websites](https://commission.europa.eu/languages-our-websites_en)\n*   [Cookies](https://commission.europa.eu/cookies_en)\n*   [Privacy policy](https://commission.europa.eu/privacy-policy_en)\n*   [Legal notice](https://commission.europa.eu/legal-notice_en)\n```",
