Failure in these functions can lead to serious health and safety consequences.\n\n### Definition 15: ‘Instructions for Use’\n\n**Definition**: Information provided by the provider to inform users about what an AI system's intended purpose is and proper usage methods.\n\n### Definition 16: ‘Recall of an AI System’\n\n**Definition**: Any measure aimed at achieving immediate removal from service if needed due to concerns regarding compliance with required requirements set out in Chapter III Section 2.\n\n### Definition 17: ‘Withdrawal of an AI System’\n\n**Definition**: Any measure aimed at preventing further availability if there were issues with compliance with required requirements set out in Chapter III Section 2 leading to modifications to its intended purpose.\n\n### Definition 18: ‘Performance of an AI System’\n\n**Definition**: Ability to achieve its intended purpose effectively without causing unintended side effects like malfunctions affecting health and safety.\n\n### Definition 19: ‘Notifying Authority’\n\n**Definition**: National authority responsible for setting up and implementing necessary procedures for assessing conformity assessment bodies and monitoring them according to relevant Union harmonization legislation provisions related to conformity assessments.\n\n### Definition 20: ‘Conformity Assessment’\n\n**Definition**: Process performed by third-party organizations such as testing companies (certification), inspectors etc., confirming whether requirements outlined in Chapter III Section 2 have been met by an entity placing products (including software) onto markets within Europe. This includes testing beyond just conformity checks conducted during initial development phases prior to placement on markets. It involves evaluating performance outcomes once deployed into real-world settings while considering factors like environmental conditions impacting performance accuracy. Additionally it encompasses conducting evaluations before deploying new versions based upon changes made since previous iterations were released so as ensure ongoing adherence towards original design goals despite evolving technological advancements over time. Such evaluations must consider both internal quality assurance processes as well as external validation mechanisms tailored specifically toward validating performance outcomes achieved via implementation thereof within real-world contexts rather than solely focused merely upon testing completed within controlled laboratory environments devoid altogether any reference whatsoever
