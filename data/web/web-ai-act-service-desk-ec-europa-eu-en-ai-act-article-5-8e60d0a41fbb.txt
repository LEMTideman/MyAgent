# Article 5: Prohibited AI practices

## Summary

[Article 5](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-5) prohibits the placing on the EU market, putting into service or use of certain AI systems for manipulative, exploitative and social scoring practices, which by their inherent nature violate fundamental rights and EU values. It also outlaws certain AI systems used for individual criminal offence risk assessment and prediction based solely on profiling or personality traits and characteristics, untargeted scraping to develop facial recognition databases, emotion recognition and biometric categorization. Real-time remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces for the purposes of law enforcement is also prohibited with some exceptions.

The summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.

### Section 1: Prohibited AI Practices

1. The following AI practices shall be prohibited:

   - **(a)** The placing on the market, the putting into service, or the use of an AI system that deploys subliminal techniques beyond a person's consciousness or purposely manipulative or deceptive techniques, with the objective or effect of materially distorting behavior of a person or a group of persons by appreciably impairing their ability to make an informed decision, thereby causing them to take a decision that they would not have otherwise taken in a manner that causes or is reasonably likely to cause that person, another person, or group of persons significant harm.
   
   - **(b)** The placing on the market, the putting into service, or the use of an AI system that exploits any of the vulnerabilities of a natural person or a specific group of persons due to their age, disability, or specific social or economic situation, with the objective or effect of materially distorting behavior of that person or a person belonging to that group in a manner that causes or is reasonably likely to cause that person or another person significant harm.
   
   - **(c)** The placing on the market, the putting into service, or the use of an AI system for evaluating or classifying natural persons over a certain period of time based on their social behavior or known, inferred, or predicted personal or personality characteristics, with either:
     - (i) Detrimental or unfavorable treatment of certain natural persons or groups of persons in social contexts unrelated to those in which the data was originally generated or collected;
     - (ii) Detrimental or unfavorable treatment of certain natural persons or groups of persons that is unjustified or disproportionate to their social behavior.
   
   - **(d)** The placing on the market, the putting into service, or the use of an AI system for making risk assessments of natural persons in order to assess或predict risk levels using solely profiling individuals' personal characteristics without relying on objective and verifiable facts directly linked to criminal offenses.

2. Each use for law enforcement purposes involving 'real-time' remote biometric identification systems in public spaces shall be authorized only if they meet necessary and proportionate safeguards and conditions regarding temporal duration、geographic scope、and personal limitation. They must be authorized only if they satisfy criteria such as temporal duration、geographic scope、and personal limitation. Each authorization shall require basic rights impact assessment as per [Article 27](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-27). Authorization can be revoked if there are sufficient grounds for revocation.

3. For law enforcement purposes involving 'real-time' remote biometric identification systems in public spaces for any reason listed in paragraph 1 first subparagraph point (h), each such use shall be subject to prior approval granted by a judicial authority 或独立行政机构的决定，且该决定是法律约束的。在紧急情况下，使用这些系统无需注册即可。

4. Each use involving 'real-time' remote biometric identification systems in public spaces for law enforcement purposes for any reason listed in paragraph 1 first subparagraph point (h), including criminal offense risk assessment based solely on profiling individuals' personal characteristics without reliance on objective and verifiable facts directly linked to criminal offenses shall be reported annually to national market surveillance authorities and dataprtection authorities within Member States who have been notified according to rule 5.

5. A Member State may decide to provide additional restrictions on 'real-time' remote biometric identification systems in public spaces for law enforcement purposes within limits and under conditions listed in paragraph 1 first subparagraph point (h).

6. National market surveillance authorities and dataprtection authorities within Member States receiving notifications about these uses shall submit annual reports to Commission at latest 30 days after adopting rules.

7. Annual reports published by Commission will not include sensitive operational data associated with related law enforcement activities.

8. This Article does not affect prohibitions applicable where an AI practice violates other Union laws.
