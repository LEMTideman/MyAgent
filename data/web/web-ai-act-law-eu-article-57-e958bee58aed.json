Member States shall ensure that their competent authorities establish at least one AI regulatory sandbox at national level, which shall be operational by 2 August 2026.\n2. That sandbox may also be established jointly with the competent authorities of other Member States.\n3. The Commission may provide technical support, advice and tools for the establishment and operation of AI regulatory sandboxes.\n\nThe obligation under the first subparagraph may also be fulfilled by participating in an existing sandbox in so far as that participation provides an equivalent level of national coverage for the participating Member States.\n\nAdditional AI regulatory sandboxes at regional or local level, or established jointly with the competent authorities of other Member States may also be established.\n\nThe European Data Protection Supervisor may also establish an AI regulatory sandbox for Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, and may exercise the roles and the tasks of national competent authorities in accordance with this Chapter.\n\n1. Member States shall ensure that the competent authorities referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 allocate sufficient resources to comply with this Article effectively and in a timely manner.\n2. Where appropriate, national competent authorities shall cooperate with other relevant authorities, and may allow for the involvement of other actors within the AI ecosystem.\n3. This Article shall not affect other regulatory sandboxes established under Union or national law.\n4. Member States shall ensure an appropriate level of cooperation between the authorities supervising those other sandboxes and the national competent authorities.\n\nAI regulatory sandboxes established under paragraph 1 shall provide for a controlled environment that fosters innovation and facilitates the development, training, testing and validation of innovative AI systems for a limited time before their being placed on the market or put into service pursuant to a specific sandbox plan agreed between the providers or prospective providers and the competent authority. Such sandboxes may include testing in real world conditions supervised therein.\n\nCompetent authorities shall provide, as appropriate, guidance, supervision and support within the AI regulatory sandbox with a view to identifying risks, in particular to fundamental rights, health and safety, testing, mitigation measures, and their effectiveness in relation to the obligations and requirements of this Regulation and, where relevant, other Union and national law supervised within the sandbox.\n\nCompetent authorities shall provide providers and prospective providers participating in the AI regulatory sandbox with guidance on regulatory expectations and how to fulfill the requirements and obligations set out in this Regulation.\n\n1.

The competent authority shall also provide an exit report detailing the activities carried out in the sandbox and related results and learning outcomes.\n3. Providers may use such documentation to demonstrate their compliance with this Regulation through the conformity assessment process or relevant market surveillance activities.\n4.

The AI regulatory sandboxes shall not affect supervisory or corrective powers of competent authorities overseeing these sandboxes—including at regional or local levels.\n2. Any significant risks to health & safety & fundamental rights identified during development & testing shall result in adequate mitigation.\n3. National competent authorities will have power temporarily or permanently suspend testing process/or participation if no effective mitigation is possible; informed suspension decisions must notify AI Office.\n4. National competent authorities will exercise supervisory powers within limits prescribed by applicable law using discretionary powers when implementing legal provisions pertaining a specific sandbox project aimed at supporting innovation in AI technology; actions considered necessary due implementation legal provisions pertaining a specific sandbox project will be deemed appropriate steps towards achieving objectives outlined herein.\n\n1. Providers participating in an AI regulatory sandbox are liable under applicable Union & national liability laws for damages inflicted on third parties resulting from experimentation taking place within said sandbox(s).\n2. However provided that prospective providers observe specific plan/sandbox terms & conditions & follow good faith guidance from national competent authority no administrative fines will apply regarding infringement(s) concerning this regulation unless another entity responsible for different Union & national law was actively involved in supervision within said sandbox(s) & provided guidance for compliance.\n3.
