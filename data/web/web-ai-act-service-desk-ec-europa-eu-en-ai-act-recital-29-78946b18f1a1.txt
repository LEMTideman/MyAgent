# Recital 29

AI-enabled manipulative techniques can be used to persuade persons to engage in unwanted behaviors, or to deceive them by nudging them into decisions in a way that subverts and impairs their autonomy, decision-making, and free choices. The placing on the market, the putting into service, or the use of certain AI systems with the objective to or the effect of materially distorting human behavior, whereby significant harms, in particular having sufficiently important adverse impacts on physical, psychological health, or financial interests are likely to occur, are particularly dangerous and should therefore be prohibited. Such AI systems deploy subliminal components such as audio, image, video stimuli that persons cannot perceive, as those stimuli are beyond human perception, or other manipulative or deceptive techniques that subvert or impair one's autonomy, decision-making, or free choice in ways that people are not consciously aware of those techniques or, where they are aware of them, can still be deceived or are not able to control or resist them. This could be facilitated, for example, by machine-brain interfaces or virtual reality as they allow for a higher degree of control of what stimuli are presented to persons, insofar as they may materially distort their behavior in a significantly harmful manner. In addition, AI systems may also otherwise exploit the vulnerabilities of a person or a specific group of persons due to their age, disability within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2019/882 of the European Parliament and of the Council, or a specific social or economic situation that is likely to make those persons more vulnerable to exploitation such as persons living in extreme poverty, ethnic or religious minorities. Such AI systems can be placed on the market, put into service, or used with the objective to or the effect of materially distorting the behavior of a person and in a manner that causes or is reasonably likely to cause significant harm to that or another person(s), including harms that may accumulate over time and should therefore be prohibited. It may not be possible to assume that there is an intention to distort behavior where the distortion results from factors external to the AI system which are outside the control of the provider or the deployer, namely factors that may not be reasonably foreseeable and therefore not possible for the provider or the deployer of the AI system to mitigate. In any case,
