Providers must draw a machine-readable, physical or electronically signed EU declaration of conformity for each AI system, which must be kept for 10 years and made available to authorities upon request. This declaration should confirm that the AI system meets specific requirements and include detailed information as outlined in [Annex V](/en/ai-act/annex-5). If the AI system is subject to other EU regulations, a single declaration covering all applicable laws is required. Providers are responsible for ensuring the declaration is accurate and up-to-date.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n1. The provider shall draw up a written machine readable, physical or electronically signed EU declaration of conformity for each high-risk AI system, and keep it at the disposal of the national competent authorities for 10 years after the high-risk AI system has been placed on the market or put into service. The EU declaration of conformity shall identify the high-risk AI system for which it has been drawn up. A copy of the EU declaration of conformity shall be submitted to the relevant national competent authorities upon request.\n\n2. The EU declaration of conformity shall state that the high-risk AI system concerned meets the requirements set out in Section 2. The EU declaration of conformity shall contain the information set out in [Annex V](/en/ai-act/annex-5), and shall be translated into a language that can be easily understood by the national competent authorities of the Member States in which the high-risk AI system is placed on the market or made available.\n\n3. Where high-risk AI systems are subject to other Union harmonisation legislation which also requires an EU declaration of conformity, a single EU declaration of conformity shall be drawn up in respect of all Union law applicable to the high-risk AI system. The declaration shall contain all the information required to identify the Union harmonisation legislation to which the declaration relates.\n\n4. By drawing up the EU declaration of conformity, the provider shall assume responsibility for compliance with the requirements set out in Section 2. The provider shall keep the EU declaration of conformity up-to-date as appropriate.\n\n5. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with [Article 97](/en/ai-act/article-97) in order to amend [Annex V](/en/ai-act/annex-5) by updating the content of the EU declaration of conformity set out in that Annex, in order to introduce elements that become necessary in light of technical progress.\n```",
