If these standards are not fully applied or are restricted, or common specifications were not available or were not applied by the provider, assessment with a notified body is required.\n\nFor high-risk AI systems listed in points 2 to 8 of [Annex III](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-3), providers must follow an internal control conformity assessment without involving a notified body.\n\nFor high-risk AI systems covered by existing EU legislation listed in Section A of [Annex I](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-1), the provider must follow the relevant conformity assessment procedures, with notified bodies ensuring compliance with AI-specific requirements. Substantial modifications to AI systems require new conformity assessments, except for predetermined changes in systems that continue to learn.\n\nHigh-risk AI systems must undergo a new conformity assessment if substantially modified, unless changes are predetermined and documented. The Commission can update annexes and conformity assessment procedures through delegated acts, considering the effectiveness of internal control and the capacity of notified bodies.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n## Article 43: Conformity assessment\n\n### For high-risk AI systems listed in point 1 of [Annex III](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-3)\n\nFor high-risk AI systems listed in point 1 of [Annex III](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-3), where, in demonstrating the compliance of a high-risk AI system with the requirements set out in Section 2, the provider has applied harmonised standards referred to in [Article 40](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-40), or, where applicable, common specifications referred to in [Article 41](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-41), the provider shall opt for one of the following conformity assessment procedures based on:\n\n(a) the internal control referred to in [Annex VI](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-6); or\n\n(b) the assessment of the quality management system and the assessment of the technical documentation, with the involvement of a notified body, referred to in [Annex VII](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-7).\n\nIn demonstrating the compliance of a high-risk AI system with the requirements set out in Section 2, the provider shall follow the conformity assessment procedure set out in [Annex VII](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/annex-7) where:\n\n(a) harmonised standards referred to in [Article 40](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-40) do not exist, and common specifications referred to in [Article 41](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/_ai_ _Act/article_ _41_) are not available;\n\n(b) the provider has not applied, or has applied only part of, the harmonised standard;\n\n(c) the common specifications referred to in point (a) exist, but the provider has not applied them;\n\n(d) one or more of the harmonised standards referred to in point (a) has been published with a restriction, and only on the part of the standard that was restricted.\n\nFor the purposes of the conformity assessment procedure referred to in [Annex VII](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/_en_/en/AI_Act/article_77.html), the provider may choose any of the notified bodies. However, where the high-risk AI system is intended to be put into service by law enforcement, immigration or asylum authorities or by Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, the market surveillance authority referred to in [Article 74(8)](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/_en_/en/AI_Act/article_74.html) or (9), as applicable, shall act as a notified body.\n\n### For high-risk AI systems referred to in points 2 to 8 of [Annex III](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.edu.en/AI_Act/article_75.html)\n\nFor high-risk AI systems referred to in points 2 to 8 of [Annex III](https://iailaw.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/59/files/AI%20ACT%20ANNEX%20III.pdf), providers shall follow the conformity assessment procedure based on internal control as referred to in [Annex VI](https://iailaw.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/59/files/AI%20ACT%20ANNEX%20VI.pdf), which does not provide for the involvement of a notified body.\n\n### For high-risk AI systems covered by Union harmonisation legislation listed in Section A of [Annex I](https://iailaw.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/59/files/AI%20ACT%20ANNEX%20I.pdf)\n\nFor high-risk AI systems covered by Union harmonisation legislation listed in Section A of [Annex I](https://iailaw.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/59/files/AI%20ACT%20ANNEX%20I.pdf), providers shall follow the relevant conformity assessment procedure as required under those legal acts. The requirements set out in Section 2 of this Chapter shall apply to those high-risk AI systems and shall be part of that assessment. Points 4.3., 4.4., 4.5. and paragraph’s five paragraph “and” before “six.” (“and”) will also apply.\n\nFor instance:\n* Paragraphs “and”\n* Point “five”\n\nFor example:\n* Paragraph “and”\n* Point “five”\n\n### High-risk AI systems that have already been subject to a conformity assessment procedure\n\nHigh-risk AI systems that have already been subject to a conformity assessment procedure shall undergo a new conformity assessment procedure in case they have undergone substantial modifications since their initial certification process. This applies even if modified versions remain operational while other versions have ceased operation due to discontinuation.\n\n### Amendments\n\nThe Commission can update Annexes VI and VII through delegated acts considering technical progress and assessing their effectiveness against internal controls aimed at preventing health-related risks posed by such devices.\n\nThe Commission can also amend paragraphs “and” before “six.” (“and”)\n```",
