# Recital 42

In line with the presumption of innocence, natural persons in the Union should always be judged on their actual behavior. Natural persons should never be judged on AI-predicted behavior based solely on their profiling, personality traits, or characteristics, such as nationality, place of birth, place of residence, number of children, level of debt, or type of car, without a reasonable suspicion of that person being involved in a criminal activity based on objective verifiable facts and without human assessment thereof. Therefore, risk assessments carried out with regard to natural persons in order to assess the likelihood of their offending or to predict the occurrence of an actual or potential criminal offense based solely on profiling them or on assessing their personality traits and characteristics should be prohibited. In any case, that prohibition does not refer to or touch upon risk analytics that are not based on the profiling of individuals or on the personality traits and characteristics of individuals, such as AI systems using risk analytics to assess the likelihood of financial fraud by undertakings on the basis of suspicious transactions or risk analytic tools to predict the likelihood of localization of narcotics or illicit goods by customs authorities, for example on the basis of known trafficking routes.
