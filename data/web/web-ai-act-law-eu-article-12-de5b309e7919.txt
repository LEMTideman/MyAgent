# Art. 12 AI Act - Record-keeping

## Main Content

High-risk AI systems shall technically allow for the automatic recording of events (logs) over the lifetime of the system.

In order to ensure a level of traceability of the functioning of a high-risk AI system that is appropriate to the intended purpose of the system, logging capabilities shall enable the recording of events relevant for:

1. Identifying situations that may result in the high-risk AI system presenting a risk within the meaning of [Article 79(1)](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/79/) or in a substantial modification;
2. Facilitating the post-market monitoring referred to in [Article 72](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/72/); and
3. Monitoring the operation of high-risk AI systems referred to in [Article 26(5)](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/26/).

For high-risk AI systems referred to in point 1(a), of [Annex III](https://ai-act-law.eu/annex/3/), the logging capabilities shall provide, at a minimum:

1. Recording of the period of each use of the system (start date and time and end date and time);
2. The reference database against which input data has been checked by the system;
3. The input data for which the search has led to a match;
4. The identification of the natural persons involved in the verification of the results, as referred to in [Article 14(5)](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/14/).
