They must consider the provider's size, sector, structure, and system complexity, but ensure compliance with the AI Act’s requirements. Notified bodies must make all relevant documentation available to the notifying authority upon request to facilitate assessment and monitoring activities.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n1. Notified bodies shall verify the conformity of high-risk AI systems in accordance with the conformity assessment procedures set out in [Article 43](/en/ai-act/article-43).\n2. Notified bodies shall avoid unnecessary burdens for providers when performing their activities, and take due account of the size of the provider, the sector in which it operates, its structure and the degree of complexity of the high-risk AI system concerned, in particular in view of minimising administrative burdens and compliance costs for micro- and small enterprises within the meaning of Recommendation 2003/361/EC. The notified body shall, nevertheless, respect the degree of rigour and the level of protection required for the compliance of the high-risk AI system with the requirements of this Regulation.\n3. Notified bodies shall make available and submit upon request all relevant documentation, including the providers’ documentation, to the notifying authority referred to in [Article 28](/en/ai-act/article-28) to allow that authority to conduct its assessment, designation, notification and monitoring activities, and to facilitate the assessment outlined in this Section.\n\n### Relevant recitals\n*   [Recital 64](/en/ai-act/recital-64)\n*   [Recital 124](/en/ai-act/recital-124)\n*   [Recital 125](/en/ai-act/recital-125)\n*   [Recital 126](/en/ai-act/recital-126)\n*   [Recital 146](/en/ai-act/recital-146)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).
