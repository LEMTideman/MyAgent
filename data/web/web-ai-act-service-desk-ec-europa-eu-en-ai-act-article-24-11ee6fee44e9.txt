**Summary**

Before distributing a high-risk AI system, distributors must verify it has the CE marking, EU declaration of conformity, and instructions for use, and that providers and importers have met their obligations. If a distributor suspects non-compliance, they must not release the system and must inform the provider or importer. Distributors must ensure proper storage and transport conditions and take corrective actions if they identify issues post-release, informing relevant parties and authorities. They must provide necessary information to authorities upon request and cooperate with them to mitigate risks.

1. Before making a high-risk AI system available on the market, distributors shall verify that it bears the required CE marking, that it is accompanied by a copy of the EU declaration of conformity referred to in [Article 47](/en/ai-act/article-47) and instructions for use, and that the provider and the importer of that system, as applicable, have complied with their respective obligations as laid down in [Article 16](/en/ai-act/article-16), points (b) and (c) and [Article 23(3)](/en/ai-act/article-23).

2. Where a distributor considers or has reason to consider, on the basis of the information in its possession, that a high-risk AI system is not in conformity with the requirements set out in Section 2, it shall not make the high-risk AI system available on the market until the system has been brought into conformity with those requirements. Furthermore, where the high-risk AI system presents a risk within the meaning of [Article 79(1)](/en/ai-act/article-79), the distributor shall inform the provider or the importer of the system, as applicable, to that effect.

3. Distributors shall ensure that, while a high-risk AI system is under their responsibility, storage or transport conditions, where applicable, do not jeopardise the compliance of the system with the requirements set out in Section 2.

A distributor that considers or has reason to consider, on the basis of the information in its possession, a high-risk AI system which it has made available on the market not to be in conformity with the requirements set out in Section 2, shall take the corrective actions necessary to bring that system into conformity with those requirements, to withdraw it or recall it, or shall ensure that the provider, the importer or any relevant operator, as appropriate, takes those corrective actions. Where the high-risk AI system presents a risk within the meaning of [Article 79(1)](/en/ai-act/article-79), the distributor shall immediately inform the provider or importer of the system and notify relevant parties and authorities about non-compliance.
