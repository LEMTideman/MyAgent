In this regard, the principles of data minimisation and data protection by design and by default, as set out in Union data protection law, are applicable when personal data are processed. Measures taken by providers to ensure compliance with those principles may include not only anonymisation and encryption, but also the use of technology that permits algorithms to be brought to the data and allows training of AI systems without the transmission between parties or copying of the raw or structured data themselves, without prejudice to the requirements on data governance provided for in this Regulation.\n\n## This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 10: Data and data governance](/en/ai-act/article-10)\n\n---\n\n[![European Commission logo](https://webtools.europa.eu/images/flags/eu.svg)](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en)\n\n**AI Act Service Desk**\n\nThis site is managed by:\nDirectorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology\n\n*   [Accessibility](/en/accessibility-statement)\n\n### Contact us\n\n*   [Contact the AI Office](mailto:CNECT-AIOFFICE@ec.europa.eu)\n\n### About us\n\n*   [Copyright notice](/en/copyright-notice)\n*   [Legal notice](/en/legal-notice)\n*   [Privacy statement](/en/privacy-statement-ai-act-service-desk-website)\n*   [About Directorate-General CONNECT](https://commission.europa.eu/about/departments-and-executive-agencies/communications-networks-content-and-technology_en)\n\n[![European Commission logo](https://webtools.europa.eu/images/flags/eu.svg)](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en)\n\n**AI Act Service Desk**\n\nThis site is managed by:\nDirectorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology\n\n*   [Accessibility](/en/accessibility-statement)\n\n### Contact us\n\n*   [Contact the AI Office](mailto:CNECT-AIOFFICE@ec.europa.eu)\n\n### About us\n\n*   [Copyright notice](/en/copyright-notice)\n*   [Legal notice](/en/legal-notice)\n*   [Privacy statement](/en/privacy-statement-ai-act-service-desk-website)\n*   [About Directorate-General CONNECT](https://commission.europa.eu/about/departments-and-executive-agencies/communications-networks-content-and-technology_en)\n\n[![European Commission logo](https://webtools.europa.eu/images/flags/eu.svg)](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en)\n\n**AI Act Service Desk**\n\nThis site is managed by:\nDirectorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology\n\n*   [Accessibility](/en/accessibility-statement)\n\n### Contact us\n\n*   [Contact the AI Office](mailto:CNECT-AIOFFICE@ec.europa.eu)\n\n### About us\n\n*   [Copyright notice](/en/copyright-notice)\n*   [Legal notice](/en/legal-notice)\n*   [Privacy statement](/en/privacy-statement-ai-act-service-desk-website)\n*   [About Directorate-General CONNECT](https://commission.europa.eu/about/departments-and-executive-agencies/communications-networks-content-and-technology_en)\n```",
