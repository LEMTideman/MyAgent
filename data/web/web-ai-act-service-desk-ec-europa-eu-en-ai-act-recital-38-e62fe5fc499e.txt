# Recital 38

The use of AI systems for real-time remote biometric identification of natural persons in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement necessarily involves the processing of biometric data. The rules of this Regulation that prohibit, subject to certain exceptions, such use, which are based on [Article 16](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-16) TFEU, should apply as _lex specialis_ in respect of the rules on the processing of biometric data contained in [Article 10](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-10) of Directive (EU) 2016/680, thus regulating such use and the processing of biometric data involved in an exhaustive manner. Therefore, such use and processing should be possible only in as far as it is compatible with the framework set by this Regulation, without there being scope, outside that framework, for the competent authorities, where they act for purpose of law enforcement, to use such systems and process such data in connection thereto on the grounds listed in [Article 10](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-10) of Directive (EU) 2016/680. In that context, this Regulation is not intended to provide the legal basis for the processing of personal data under [Article 8](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-8) of Directive (EU) 2016/680. However, the use of real-time remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for purposes other than law enforcement, including by competent authorities, should not be covered by the specific framework regarding such use for the purpose of law enforcement set by this Regulation. Such use for purposes other than law enforcement should therefore not be subject to the requirement of an authorisation under this Regulation and the applicable detailed rules of national law that may give effect to that authorisation.
