The technical documentation of the AI system shall be examined in accordance with point 4.\n\n## Quality Management System\n\n### 3.1 The application of the provider shall include:\n\n- (a) the name and address of the provider and, if the application is lodged by an authorised representative, also their name and address;\n- (b) the list of AI systems covered under the same quality management system;\n- (c) the technical documentation for each AI system covered under the same quality management system;\n- (d) the documentation concerning the quality management system which shall cover all the aspects listed under [Article 17](/en/ai-act/article-17);\n- (e) a description of the procedures in place to ensure that the quality management system remains adequate and effective;\n- (f) a written declaration that the same application has not been lodged with any other notified body.\n\n### 3.2 The quality management system shall be assessed by the notified body, which shall determine whether it satisfies the requirements referred to in [Article 17](/en/ai-act/article-17). The decision shall be notified to the provider or its authorised representative. The notification shall contain the conclusions of the assessment of the quality management system and the reasoned assessment decision.\n\n### 3.3 The quality management system as approved shall continue to be implemented and maintained by the provider so that it remains adequate and efficient.\n\n### 3.4 Any intended change to the approved quality management system or the list of AI systems covered by the latter shall be brought to the attention of the notified body by the provider. The proposed changes shall be examined by the notified body, which shall decide whether the modified quality management system continues to satisfy the requirements referred to in point 3.2 or whether an reassessment is necessary. The notified body shall notify the provider of its decision. The notification shall contain the conclusions of the examination of these changes and a reasoned assessment decision.\n\n## Control of Technical Documentation\n\n### 4.1 In addition to applying principles outlined in point 3, an application with a notified body should be lodged by a provider for assessing technical documentation relating to an AI system which is covered by a quality management system referred to under point 3.\n\n### 4.2 The application should include:\n- (a) details about who submitted it;\n- (b) a written declaration that no similar applications have been made with any other notified body;\n- (c) technical documentation provided according to [Annex IV](/en/ai-act/annex-4).\n\n### 4.3 Technical documentation must undergo examination by a notified body. If necessary, additional tests may need to be conducted.\n\n### 4.4 Examinations can be supplemented with further evidence or tests if deemed necessary due to limitations imposed by available resources.\n\n### 4.5 Where required for assessing high-risk AI systems, access can be granted without prior approval from another notified body but must comply with existing Union law on intellectual property protection and trade secrets.\n\n### 4.6 Notifications regarding changes within organizations are mandatory when there's reason to believe they could affect compliance with legal requirements or their intended purpose.\n\n## Surveillance\n\n### 5.1 Surveillance aims at ensuring compliance with terms and conditions applied under point 3 throughout implementation phases.\n\n### 5.2 Providers must allow access for inspections related to compliance checks performed by authorized bodies.\n\n### 5.3 Periodic audits are conducted by authorized bodies to confirm ongoing adherence to approved quality frameworks and maintain effectiveness.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nView official text: [Artificial Intelligence Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689)\n```",
