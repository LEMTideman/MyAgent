  "text": "```markdown\n# Article 83: Formal Non-Compliance\n\n## Summary\n\nThis article specifies the actions market surveillance authorities must take when they identify non-compliance issues with high-risk AI systems. These issues include improper CE marking, missing or incorrect EU declarations of conformity, failure to register in the EU database, lack of an authorized representative, or unavailable technical documentation. The authority will require the provider to address these non-compliance issues within a specified timeframe. If the non-compliance persists, the authority will take measures to restrict, prohibit, recall, or withdraw the AI system from the market.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n## Relevant Recitals\n\n* [Recital 160](/en/ai-act/recital-160)\n\n---\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).
