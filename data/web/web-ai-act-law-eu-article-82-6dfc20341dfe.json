The Member States shall immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States of a finding under paragraph 1.\n2. That information shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the AI system concerned, the origin and the supply chain of the AI system, the nature of the risk involved and the nature and duration of the national measures taken.\n\n1. The Commission shall without undue delay enter into consultation with the Member States concerned and the relevant operators, and shall evaluate the national measures taken.\n2. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall decide whether the measure is justified and, where necessary, propose other appropriate measures.\n\n1. The Commission shall immediately communicate its decision to the Member States concerned and to the relevant operators.\n2. It shall also inform the other Member States.\n\n[←Art. 81 AI Act](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/81/)  \n[Art. 83 AI Act→](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/83/)\n```",
