============================================

1. Before making a high-risk AI system available on the market, distributors shall verify that it bears the required CE marking, that it is accompanied by a copy of the EU declaration of conformity referred to in [Article 47](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/47/) and instructions for use, and that the provider and the importer of that system, as applicable, have complied with their respective obligations as laid down in [Article 16](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/16), points (b) and (c) and [Article 23(3)](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/23/).
2. Where a distributor considers or has reason to consider, on the basis of the information in its possession, that a high-risk AI system is not in conformity with the requirements set out in [Section 2](https://ai-act-law.eu/chapter/3/), it shall not make the high-risk AI system available on the market until the system has been brought into conformity with those requirements.
3. Furthermore, where the high-risk AI system presents a risk within the meaning of [Article 79(1)](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/79/), the distributor shall inform the provider or the importer of the system, as applicable, to that effect.
4. Distributors shall ensure that, while a high-risk AI system is under their responsibility, storage or transport conditions, where applicable, do not jeopardise the compliance of the system with the requirements set out in [Section 2](https://ai-act-law.eu/chapter/3/).
5. A distributor that considers or has reason to consider, on the basis of the information in its possession, a high-risk AI system which it has made available on the market not to be in conformity with the requirements set out in [Section 2](https://ai-act-law.eu/chapter/3/), shall take the corrective actions necessary to bring that system into conformity with those requirements, to withdraw it or recall it, or shall ensure that the provider, the importer or any relevant operator, as appropriate, takes those corrective actions.
6. Where the high-risk AI system presents a risk within the meaning of [Article 79(1)](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/79/), the distributor shall immediately inform the provider or importer of the system and notify them via email if possible about any corrective actions taken.
7. Upon a reasoned request from a relevant competent authority, distributors of a high-risk AI system shall provide that authority with all the information and documentation regarding their actions pursuant to paragraphs 1 to 4 necessary to demonstrate their compliance with these requirements.
