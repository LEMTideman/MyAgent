For AI systems provided digitally, a digital CE marking must be easily accessible. The CE marking must be clearly visible and permanent, or affixed to the packaging or documentation if not possible. Where applicable, the marking should include the identification number of the notified body responsible for conformity assessment. If the AI system is subject to other EU laws requiring CE marking, the marking must indicate compliance with those laws as well.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n### Recitals\n* [Recital 129](/en/ai-act/recital-129)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).

For AI systems provided digitally, a digital CE marking must be used, only if it can easily be accessed via the interface from which that system is accessed or via an easily accessible machine-readable code or other electronic means.\n\nThe CE marking shall be affixed visibly, legibly and indelibly for high-risk AI systems. Where that is not possible or not warranted on account of the nature of high the-risk AI system, it shall be affixed to the packaging or to the accompanying documentation, as appropriate.\n\nWhere applicable, the CE marking shall be followed by the identification number of the notified body responsible for the conformity assessment procedures set out in Article 43. The identification number of the notified body shall be affixed by the body itself or, under its instructions, by the provider or by the provider’s authorised representative. The identification number shall also be indicated in any promotional material which mentions that the high-risk AI system fulfils the requirements for CE marking.\n\nWhere high-risk AI systems are subject to other Union law which also provides for the affixing of the CE marking, the CE marking shall indicate that the high-risk AI system also fulfill's the requirements of that other law.\n\n#### Relevant recitals\n* [Recital 129](/en/ai-act/recital-129)\n\n---\n\n## Footer\n\n### Contact Us\n**AI Act Service Desk**\nThis site is managed by:\nDirectorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology\n\n[Contact us here](mailto:CNECT-AIOFFICE@ec.europa.eu)\n\n### About Us\n* [Accessibility Statement](/en/accessibility-statement)\n\n### Legal Information\n* Copyright Notice\n* Legal Notice\n* Privacy Statement\n* About Directorate-General CONNECT\n\n[Commission Website](https://commission.europa.eu/index_en)\n\n### Social Media & Additional Links\n[Contact Commission on Social Media](https://european-union.europa.eu/contact-eu/social-media-channels_en#/search?page=0&institutions=european_commission)\n[Resources for Partners](https://commission.europa.eu/resources-partners_en)\n[Report an IT Vulnerability](https://commission.europa.eu/resources-partners_en?tab=report_vulnerability \"Report an IT vulnerability\")\n[Languages on Our Websites](https://commission.europa.eu/languages-our-websites_en)\n[Cookies Policy](https://commission.europa.eu/cookies_en)\n[Privacy Policy](https://commission.europa.eu/privacy-policy_en)\n[Legal Notice](https://commission.europa.eu/legal-notice_en)\n\n© European Commission - All Rights Reserved.\n```",
