In order to avoid fragmentation across the Union, the Commission shall adopt implementing acts specifying the detailed arrangements for the establishment, development, implementation, operation and supervision of the AI regulatory sandboxes.\n2. The implementing acts shall include common principles on the following issues:\n   1. eligibility and selection criteria for participation in the AI regulatory sandbox;\n   2. procedures for the application, participation, monitoring, exiting from and termination of the AI regulatory sandbox, including the sandbox plan and the exit report;\n   3. the terms and conditions applicable to the participants.\n3. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in [Article 98(2)](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/98/).\n\n   The implementing acts referred to in paragraph 1 shall ensure:\n   1. that AI regulatory sandboxes are open to any applying provider or prospective provider of an AI system who fulfils eligibility and selection criteria, which shall be transparent and fair, and that national competent authorities inform applicants of their decision within three months of the application;\n   2. that AI regulatory sandboxes allow broad and equal access and keep up with demand for participation; providers and prospective providers may also submit applications in partnerships with deployers and other relevant third parties;\n   3. that the detailed arrangements for, and conditions concerning AI regulatory sandboxes support, to the best extent possible, flexibility for national competent authorities to establish and operate their AI regulatory sandboxes;\n   4. that access to the AI regulatory sandboxes is free of charge for SMEs, including start-ups, without prejudice to exceptional costs that national competent authorities may recover in a fair and proportionate manner;\n   5. that they facilitate providers and prospective providers, by means of the learning outcomes of the AI regulatory sandboxes, in complying with conformity assessment obligations under this Regulation and the voluntary application of the codes of conduct referred to in [Article 95](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/95/) ;\n   6. that AI regulatory sandboxes facilitate the involvement of other relevant actors within the AI ecosystem, such as notified bodies and standardisation organizations, SMEs, including start-ups, enterprises, innovators, testing and experimentation facilities, research and experimentation labs and European Digital Innovation Hubs centers of excellence, individual researchers , in order to allow and facilitate cooperation with the public and private sectors;\n   7. that procedures, processes and administrative requirements for application, selection, participation and exiting from an AI regulatory sandbox are simple,\n      * easy intelligible,\n      * clearly communicated,\n      * facilitating participation of SMEs,\n         * particularly those starting out,\n         * with limited legal capacity\n      * but streamlined across Europe,\n      * avoiding fragmentation,\n      * so participants can benefit from mutual recognition across Europe while carrying legal effect equivalent throughout all EU member states,\n      * enabling participating entities to involve other relevant actors within their own ecosystem such as test facilities or universities;\n   8. that participation in an AI regulatory sandbox established by a Member State or by a European Data Protection Supervisor is mutually recognized across Europe through clear communication between Member States so there is consistency across Europe regarding approval or rejection of applications;\n\n4. Prospective providers in the AI regulatory sandboxes will be directed where relevant towards pre-deployment services such as guidance on compliance with this Regulation towards help with standardization documents or certification related testing facilities ,European Digital Innovation Hubs & Centers Of Excellence .\n5. Where national competent authorities consider authorizing testing in real-world conditions supervised within an AI regulatory sandbox established under this Article they shall specifically agree upon:\n   \n    - terms\n       - conditions\n       - appropriate safeguards\n    \n    With a view to protecting fundamental rights health safety.\n    \n    Where appropriate they shall cooperate with other national competent authorities regarding consistent practices across Europe.\n\n---\n\n## Suitable Recitals\n\n[142] Encourage funding for research & development on AI solutions.\n\n---\n\n[Art. 57](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/57/) - [AI Regulatory Sandboxes](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/57/)\n[Art. 59](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/59/) - [Further Processing Personal Data](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/59/)\n```",
