# Article 82: Compliant AI systems which present a risk

## Chapter IX: Post-Market Monitoring, Information Sharing and Market Surveillance
### Section 3: Enforcement

#### Summary
This article outlines the steps market surveillance authorities must take if they find that a high-risk AI system, despite complying with the AI Act, still presents risks to health, safety, fundamental rights, or public interest. The authority will require the operator to take corrective measures to mitigate these risks within a specified timeframe. The provider must ensure these actions are taken for all AI systems on the market. The Member State will inform the Commission and other Member States of the findings and measures taken. The Commission will evaluate the measures and decide if they are justified, proposing additional actions if necessary, and communicate its decision to all relevant parties.

The summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.
