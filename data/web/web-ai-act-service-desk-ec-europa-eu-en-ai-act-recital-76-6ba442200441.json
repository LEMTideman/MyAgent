Cyberattacks against AI systems can leverage AI-specific assets, such as training data sets (e.g., data poisoning) or trained models (e.g., adversarial attacks or membership inference), or exploit vulnerabilities in the AI system’s digital assets or the underlying ICT infrastructure. To ensure a level of cybersecurity appropriate to the risks, suitable measures, such as security controls, should therefore be taken by the providers of high-risk AI systems, also taking into account as appropriate the underlying ICT infrastructure.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 10: Data and data governance](/en/ai-act/article-10)\n*   [Article 15: Accuracy, robustness and cybersecurity](/en/ai-act/article-15)\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgment\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).
