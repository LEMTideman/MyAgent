Any distributor, importer, deployer or other third-party shall be considered to be a provider of a high-risk AI system for the purposes of this Regulation and shall be subject to the obligations of the provider under [Article 16](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/16/), in any of the following circumstances:\n\n    1. They put their name or trademark on a high-risk AI system already placed on the market or put into service, without prejudice to contractual arrangements stipulating that the obligations are otherwise allocated.\n    2. They make a substantial modification to a high-risk AI system that has already been placed on the market or has already been put into service in such a way that it remains a high-risk AI system pursuant to [Article 6](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/6/).\n    3. They modify the intended purpose of an AI system, including a general-purpose AI system, which has not been classified as high-risk and has already been placed on the market or put into service in such a way that the AI system concerned becomes a high-risk AI system in accordance with [Article 6](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/6/).\n\n2. Where the circumstances referred to in paragraph 1 occur, the provider that initially placed the AI system on the market or put it into service shall no longer be considered to be a provider of that specific AI system for the purposes of this Regulation. This initial provider shall closely cooperate with new providers and shall make available the necessary information and provide the reasonably expected technical access and other assistance that are required for the fulfillment of the obligations set out in this Regulation, in particular regarding compliance with conformity assessments of high-risk AI systems.\n\n3. In the case of high-risk AI systems that are safety components of products covered by Union harmonization legislation listed in Section A of [Annex I](https://ai-act-law.eu/annex/1/) , the product manufacturer shall be considered to be the provider of the high-risk AI system, and shall be subject to the obligations under [Article 16](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/16/) under either of the following circumstances:\n\n    1. The high-risk AI system is placed on the market together with the product under the name or trademark of the product manufacturer.\n    2. The high-risk AI system is put into service under the name or trademark of the product manufacturer after the product has been placed on sale.\n\n4. The provider of a high-risk AI system and the third party that supplies an AI system, tools, services, components, or processes that are used or integrated in a high-risk AI system shall, by written agreement, specify the necessary information, capabilities, technical access and other assistance based on generally acknowledged state-of-the-art knowledge, in order to enable full compliance with obligations set out in this Regulation. This paragraph shall not apply to third parties making accessible to public tools, services, processes, or components other than general-purpose AI models.\n\n5. Paragraphs 2 and 3 are without prejudice to need to observe and protect intellectual property rights, confidential business information and trade secrets in accordance with Union and national law.\n\n---\n\n### Suitable Recitals\n\n* [(83)](https://ai-act-law.eu/recital/83/) Clarification of roles and obligations\n* [(84)](https://ai-act-law.eu/recital/84/) Extension of obligations to distributors\n* [(85)](https://ai-act-law.eu/recital/85/) Cooperation with high-risk AI system providers\n* [(86)](https://ai-act-law.eu/recital/86/) Obligation for former providers\n* [(87)](https://ai-act-law.eu/recital/87/) Obligations in event of high-risk AI systems as safety component\n* [(88)](https://ai-act-law.eu/recital/88/) Written agreement on information release\n* [(89)](https://ai-act-law.eu/recital/89/) Release from value chain responsibilities\n* [(90)](https://ai-act-law.eu/recial/90/) Development voluntary model contract terms by Commission\n\n[← Art. 24: High Risk Systems](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/24/)\n[Art. 26: Deployers Responsibility →](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/26/)\n[Back To Main Page](https://ai-act-law.eu)\n```",
