# Article 41: Common Specifications

## Summary

The Commission can adopt implementing acts to establish common specifications for high-risk AI systems or general-purpose AI models if harmonized standards are not available, not delivered on time, insufficiently address fundamental rights concerns, or do not comply with the request. These specifications will be developed in consultation with the advisory forum and adopted through an examination procedure set out in [Article 98 (2)](/en/ai-act/article-98). AI systems conforming to these specifications will be presumed compliant with Section 2 of Chapter 3 (Requirements for high-risk AI systems) or, where applicable, certain obligations of Chapter 5. If harmonized standards are later adopted, the Commission will repeal the relevant implementing acts. Providers not complying with the common specifications must justify their alternative technical solutions. 

The summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.
