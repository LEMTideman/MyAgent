They must inform distributors, deployers, and authorities about the issue and any actions taken. The provider must immediately investigate the causes, collaborate with the deployer if needed, and inform market surveillance authorities and the relevant notified body about the non-compliance and any corrective actions taken.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n1. Providers of high-risk AI systems which consider or have reason to consider that a high-risk AI system that they have placed on the market or put into service is not in conformity with this Regulation shall immediately take the necessary corrective actions to bring that system into conformity, to withdraw it, to disable it, or to recall it, as appropriate. They shall inform the distributors of the high-risk AI system concerned and, where applicable, the deployers, the authorised representative and importers accordingly.\n\n2. Where the high-risk AI system presents a risk within the meaning of [Article 79(1)](/en/ai-act/article-79) and the provider becomes aware of that risk, it shall immediately investigate the causes, in collaboration with the reporting deployer, where applicable, and inform the market surveillance authorities competent for the high-risk AI system concerned and, where applicable, the notified body that issued a certificate for that high-risk AI system in accordance with [Article 44](/en/ai-act/article-44), in particular, of the nature of the non-compliance and of any relevant corrective action taken.\n\n### Relevant recitals\n\n*   [Recital 81](/en/ai-act/recital-81)\n*   [Recital 155](/en/ai-act/recital-155)\n*   [Recital 159](/en/ai-act/recital-159)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).
