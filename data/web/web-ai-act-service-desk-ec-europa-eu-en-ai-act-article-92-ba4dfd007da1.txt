# Article 92: Power to conduct evaluations

## Chapter IX: Post-Market Monitoring, Information Sharing and Market Surveillance
### Section 5: Supervision, Investigation, Enforcement and Monitoring in Respect of Providers of General-Purpose AI Models

## Article 92: Power to conduct evaluations

### Summary
This article describes the AI Office's authority to conduct evaluations of general-purpose AI models to assess compliance or investigate systemic risks. The Commission can appoint independent experts to perform these evaluations and request access to the AI model through APIs or other technical means, including source code. Providers must comply with these requests or face fines. Before requesting access, the AI Office may engage in a structured dialogue with the provider to gather more information.

The summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.

### 1. The AI Office, after consulting the Board, may conduct evaluations of the general-purpose AI model concerned:
   - (a) to assess compliance of the provider with obligations under this Regulation, where the information gathered pursuant to [Article 91](/en/ai-act/article-91) is insufficient; or
   - (b) to investigate systemic risks at Union level of general-purpose AI models with systemic risk, in particular following a qualified alert from the scientific panel in accordance with [Article 90(1)](/en/ai-act/article-90), point (a).

### 2. The Commission may decide to appoint independent experts to carry out evaluations on its behalf, including from the scientific panel established pursuant to [Article 68](/en/ai-act/article-68). Independent experts appointed for this task shall meet the criteria outlined in [Article 68(2)](/en/ai-act/article-68).

### 3. For the purposes of paragraph 1, the Commission may request access to the general-purpose AI model concerned through APIs or further appropriate technical means and tools, including source code.

### 4. The request for access shall state the legal basis, the purpose and reasons of the request and set the period within which the access is to be provided, and the fines provided for in [Article 101](/en/ai-act/article-101) for failure to provide access.

### 5. The providers of the general-purpose AI model concerned or its representative shall supply the information requested. In the case of legal persons, companies or firms, or where the provider has no legal personality, the persons authorised to represent them by law or by their statutes, shall provide the access requested on behalf of the provider of the general-purpose AI model concerned.

### 6. The Commission shall adopt implementing acts setting out the detailed arrangements and conditions for the evaluations, including detailed arrangements for involving independent experts, and a procedure for selecting thereof. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in [Article 98(2)](/en/ai-act/article-98).

### 7. Prior to requesting access to the general-purpose AI model concerned, the AI Office may initiate a structured dialogue with the provider of the general-purpose AI model to gather more information on internal testing of the model, internal safeguards for preventing systemic risks, and other internal procedures and measures taken by that provider to mitigate such risks.
