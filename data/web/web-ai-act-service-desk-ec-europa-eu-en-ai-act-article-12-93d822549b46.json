High-risk AI systems must have automatic logging capabilities to record events throughout their lifecycle. These logs should help identify risks, support post-market monitoring, and track system operation. For remote biometric identification systems, logs must include usage periods, reference databases, input data, and the identities of individuals verifying results. This ensures traceability and facilitates ongoing oversight and risk management.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n### Recitals\n* [Recital 66](/en/ai-act/recital-66)\n* [Recital 71](/en/ai-act/recital-71)\n* [Recital 131](/en/ai-act/recital-131)\n\nView the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).
