Evaluation strategies should include evaluation criteria, metrics, and methodology for identifying limitations.\n  - Where applicable:\n    - a detailed description of measures put in place for internal and/or external adversarial testing (e.g., red teaming),\n    - model adaptations including alignment and fine-tuning.\n  - Where applicable:\n    - a detailed description of system architecture explaining how software components build or feed into each other and integrate into overall processing.\n\n## Section 2\n\n### Additional information to be provided by providers of general-purpose AI models with systemic risk\n\n#### Point (a)\n- A detailed description of evaluation strategies, including evaluation results on available public evaluation protocols and tools or otherwise evaluated through other evaluation methodologies. Evaluation strategies should include evaluation criteria, metrics, and methodology for identifying limitations.\n\n#### Point (b)\n- Where applicable:\n  - a detailed description of measures put in place for internal and/or external adversarial testing (e.g., red teaming).\n  \n#### Point (c)\n- Where applicable:\n  - a detailed description of system architecture explaining how software components build or feed into each other and integrate into overall processing.\n\nView [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).
