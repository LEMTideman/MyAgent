  "text": "```markdown\n# Recital 101\n\n## Overview\n\nProviders of general-purpose AI models have a particular role and responsibility along the AI value chain, as the models they provide may form the basis for a range of downstream systems, often provided by downstream providers that necessitate a good understanding of the models and their capabilities, both to enable the integration of such models into their products, and to fulfill their obligations under this or other regulations. Therefore, proportionate transparency measures should be laid down, including the drawing up and keeping up to date of documentation, and the provision of information on the general-purpose AI model for its usage by the downstream providers. Technical documentation should be prepared and kept up to date by the general-purpose AI model provider for the purpose of making it available, upon request, to the AI Office and the national competent authorities. The minimal set of elements to be included in such documentation should be set out in specific annexes to this Regulation. The Commission should be empowered to amend those annexes by means of delegated acts in light of evolving technological developments.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 16: Obligations of providers of high-risk AI systems](/en/ai-act/article-16)\n*   [Article 53: Obligations for providers of general-purpose AI models](/en/ai-act/article-53)\n\n---\n\n## Contact Us\n\n*   [Contact the AI Office](mailto:CNECT-AIOFFICE@ec.europa.eu)\n\n## About Us\n\n*   [Copyright notice](/en/copyright-notice)\n*   [Legal notice](/en/legal-notice)\n*   [Privacy statement](/en/privacy-statement-ai-act-service-desk-website)\n*   [About Directorate-General CONNECT](https://commission.europa.eu/about-departments-and-executive-agencies/communications-networks-content-and-technology_en)\n\n[![European Commission Logo](https://webtools.europa.eu/images/flags/eu.svg)](https://commission.europa.eu/index_en)\n\n## Social Media Links\n\n*   [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/europeancommission/)\n*   [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EU_Commission)\n*   [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/european_commission/)\n*   [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/www.europeancommission/videos?view_as=subscriber)\n*   [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/european-commission/)\n```\n\n(Note: The images were omitted as per guidelines.)\n```",
