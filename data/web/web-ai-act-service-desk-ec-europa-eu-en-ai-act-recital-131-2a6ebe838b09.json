Before using an AI system listed in the high-risk use cases in an annex to this Regulation, deployers of high-risk AI systems that are public authorities, agencies or bodies, should register themselves in such database and select the system that they envisage to use. Other deployers should be entitled to do so voluntarily. This section of the EU database should be publicly accessible, free of charge, the information should be easily navigable, understandable and machine-readable. The EU database should also be user-friendly, for example by providing search functionalities, including through keywords, allowing the general public to find relevant information to be submitted upon the registration of high-risk AI systems and on the use case of high-risk AI systems, set out in an annex to this Regulation, to which the high-risk AI systems correspond. Any substantial modification of high-risk AI systems should also be registered in the EU database. For high-risk AI systems in the area of law enforcement, migration, asylum and border control management, the registration obligations should be fulfilled in a secure non-public section of the EU database. Access to the secure non-public section should be strictly limited to the Commission as well as to market surveillance authorities with regard to their national section of that database. High-risk AI systems in the area of critical infrastructure should only be registered at national level. The Commission should be the controller of the EU database, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. In order to ensure the full functionality of the EU database, when deployed, the procedure for setting up the database should include developing functional specifications by the Commission and an independent audit report. The Commission should take into account cybersecurity risks when carrying out its tasks as data controller on the EU database. In order to maximize availability and use of the EU database by users, it is recommended that:\n\n- **Annexes**: [Annex I](/en/ai-act/annex-1)\n- **Code Of Conduct And Guidelines**: [Code Of Conduct for Voluntary Application Of Specific Requirements](/en/ai-act/article-95)\n- **Penalties**: [Penalties](/en/ai-act/article-99)\n\n## This Recital Relates To\n\n*   [Article 12: Record-Keeping](/en/ai-act/article-12)\n*   [Article 13: Transparency And Provision Of Information To Deployers](/en/ai-act/article-13)\n*   [Article 49: Registration](/en/ai-act/article-49)\n*   [Article 71: EU Database For High-Risk Ai Systems Listed In Annex III](/en/ai-act/article-71)\n\nView The Official Text: [Artificial Intelligence Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689).\n```",
