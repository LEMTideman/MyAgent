# Article 41: Common Specifications

## Summary

The Commission can adopt implementing acts to establish common specifications for high-risk AI systems or general-purpose AI models if harmonized standards are not available, not delivered on time, insufficiently address fundamental rights concerns, or do not comply with the request. These specifications will be developed in consultation with the advisory forum and adopted through an examination procedure set out in [Article 98 (2)](/en/ai-act/article-98). AI systems conforming to these specifications will be presumed compliant with Section 2 of Chapter 3 (Requirements for high-risk AI systems) or, where applicable, certain obligations of Chapter 5. If harmonized standards are later adopted, the Commission will repeal the relevant implementing acts. Providers not complying with the common specifications must justify their alternative technical solutions. 

The summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.

## Conditions for Adopting Implementing Acts

1. The Commission may adopt, implementing acts establishing common specifications for the requirements set out in Section 2 of this Chapter or, as applicable, for the obligations set out in Sections 2 and 3 of Chapter V where the following conditions have been fulfilled:

   - The Commission has requested, pursuant to [Article 10(1)](/en/ai-act/article-10) of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, one or more European standardization organizations to draft a harmonized standard for the requirements set out in Section 2 of this Chapter, or, as applicable, for the obligations set out in Sections 2 and 3 of Chapter V, and:
     - The request has not been accepted by any of the European standardization organizations; or
     - The harmonized standards addressing that request are not delivered within the deadline set in accordance with [Article 10(1)](/en/ai-act/article-10) of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012; or
     - The relevant harmonized standards insufficiently address fundamental rights concerns; or
     - The harmonized standards do not comply with the request;
   
   When drafting the common specifications, the Commission shall consult the advisory forum referred to in [Article 67](/en/ai-act/article-67).

   The implementing acts referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in [Article 98(2)](/en/ai-act/article-98).

2. Before preparing a draft implementing act, the Commission shall inform the committee referred to in [Article 22](/en/ai-act/article-22) of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 that it considers the conditions laid down in paragraph 1 of this Article to be fulfilled.

3. High-risk AI systems or general-purpose AI models which are in conformity with the common specifications referred to in paragraph 1, or parts of those specifications, shall be presumed to be in conformity with the requirements set out in Section 2 of this Chapter or, as applicable, to comply with the obligations referred to in Sections 2 and 3 of Chapter V, to the extent those common specifications cover those requirements or those obligations.

4. Where a harmonized standard is adopted by a European standardization organization and proposed to the Commission for publication of its reference in the _Official Journal of the European Union_, the Commission shall assess the harmonized standard in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012. When reference to a harmonized standard is published in the Official Journal of the European Union, the Commission shall repeal the implementing acts referred to in paragraph 1, or parts thereof which cover the same requirements set out in Section 2 of this Chapter or, as applicable, the same obligations set out in Sections 2 and 3 of Chapter V.

5. Where providers of high-risk AI systems or general-purpose AI models do not comply with the common specifications referred to in paragraph 1, they shall duly justify that they have adopted technical solutions that meet the requirements referred to in Section 2 of this Chapter or, as applicable, comply with the obligations set out in Sections 2 and 3 of Chapter V to a level at least equivalent thereto.

6. Where a Member State considers that a common specification does not entirely meet the requirements set out in Section 2 or, as applicable, comply with obligations set out in Sections 2 and 3 of Chapter V, it shall inform the Commission thereof with a detailed explanation. The Commission shall assess that information and, if appropriate, amend the implementing act establishing the common specification concerned.
