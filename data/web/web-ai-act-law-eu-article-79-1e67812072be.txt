1. AI systems presenting a risk shall be understood as a ‘product presenting a risk’ as defined in [Article 3, point 19 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32019R1020#d1e868-1-1), in so far as they present risks to the health or safety, or to fundamental rights, of persons.
   
2. <sup>1</sup> Where the market surveillance authority of a Member State has sufficient reason to consider an AI system to present a risk as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, it shall carry out an evaluation of the AI system concerned in respect of its compliance with all the requirements and obligations laid down in this Regulation. <sup>2</sup> Particular attention shall be given to AI systems presenting a risk to vulnerable groups. <sup>3</sup> Where risks to fundamental rights are identified, the market surveillance authority shall also inform and fully cooperate with the relevant national public authorities or bodies referred to in [Article 77(1)](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/77). <sup>4</sup> The relevant operators shall cooperate as necessary with the market surveillance authority and with the other national public authorities or bodies referred to in [Article 77(1)](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/77).
   
   Where, in the course of that evaluation, the market surveillance authority or, where applicable, the market surveillance authority in cooperation with the national public authority referred to in [Article 77(1)](https://ai-act-law.eu/article/77), finds that the AI system does not comply with the requirements and obligations laid down in this Regulation, it shall without undue delay require the relevant operator to take all appropriate corrective actions to bring the AI system into compliance, to withdraw the AI system from the market, or to recall it within a period specified by the market surveillance authority. <sup>1</sup> The market surveillance authority shall inform the relevant notified body accordingly. <sup>2</sup> [Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32019R1020#d1e2009-1-1) shall apply to the measures referred to in the second subparagraph of this paragraph.

3. Where the market surveillance authority considers that the non-compliance is not restricted to its national territory, it shall inform the Commission and the other Member States without undue delay of the results of the evaluation and of the actions which it has required the operator to take.

4. The operator shall ensure that all appropriate corrective action is taken in respect of all the AI systems concerned that it has made available on the Union market.

5. <sup>1</sup> Where the operator of an AI system does not take adequate corrective action within the period referred to in paragraph 2, the market surveillance authority shall take all appropriate provisional measures to prohibit or restrict the AI system’s being made available on its national market or put into service, to withdraw the product orthe standalone AI system from that market orto recall it. <sup>2</sup> That authority shall without undue delay notify the Commission and t he other Member States of those measures.
