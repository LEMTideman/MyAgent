If, despite efforts to identify and prevent risks related to a general-purpose AI model that may present systemic risks, the development or use of the model causes a serious incident, the general-purpose AI model provider should without undue delay keep track of the incident and report any relevant information and possible corrective measures to the Commission and national competent authorities. Furthermore, providers should ensure an adequate level of cybersecurity protection for the model and its physical infrastructure, if appropriate, along the entire model lifecycle. Cybersecurity protection related to systemic risks associated with malicious use or attacks should duly consider accidental model leakage, unauthorized releases, circumvention of safety measures, and defense against cyberattacks, unauthorized access or model theft. That protection could be facilitated by securing model weights, algorithms, servers, and data sets, such as through operational security measures for information security, specific cybersecurity policies, adequate technical and established solutions, and cyber and physical access controls, appropriate to the relevant circumstances and the risks involved.\n\n### This Recital relates to\n\n*   [Article 10](/en/ai-act/article-10): Data and data governance\n*   [Article 15](/en/ai-act/article-15): Accuracy, robustness and cybersecurity\n*   [Article 55](/en/ai-act/article-55): Obligations of providers of general-purpose AI models with systemic risk\n\n---\n\n## Contact Us\n\n*   [Contact the AI Office](mailto:CNECT-AIOFFICE@ec.europa.eu)\n\n## About Us\n\n*   [Copyright notice](/en/copyright-notice)\n*   [Legal notice](/en/legal-notice)\n*   [Privacy statement](/en/privacy-statement-ai-act-service-desk-website)\n*   [About Directorate-General CONNECT](https://commission.europa.eu/about-departments-and-executive-agencies/communications-networks-content-and-technology_en)\n\n[![European Commission Logo](https://webtools.europa.eu/images/flags/eu.svg)](https://commission.europa.eu/index_en)\n\n## Legal Notice\n\n*   [Accessibilty Statement](/en/accessibility-statement)\n*   [Contact the European Commission](https://commission.europa.eu/contact-eu/contact-the-european-commission_en)\n*   [Follow the European Commission on social media](https://european-union.europa.eu/contact-eu/social-media-channels_en#/search?page=0&institutions=european_commission)\n*   [Resources for partners](https://commission.europa.eu/resources-partners_en)\n*   [Report an IT vulnerability](https://commission.europa.eu/resources-partners_resources-for-partners/report-an-it-vulnerability_en)\n\n[![European Commission Logo Negative](https://webtools.europa.eu/images/flags/negative/logo-ec--en.svg)](https://commission.europa.eu/index_en)\n\n## Privacy Policy & Cookies\n\n*   [Cookie Policy](https://commission.europa.eu/cookies_en)\n*   [Privacy Policy](https://commission.europa.eu/privacy-policy_en)\n```",
