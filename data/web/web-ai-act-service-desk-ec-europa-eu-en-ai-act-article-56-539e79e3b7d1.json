These codes aim to ensure compliance with the AI Act, covering issues like documentation, copyright policy, and systemic risk management including cybersecurity. The AI Office and the Board will involve various stakeholders, monitor the implementation, and evaluate the effectiveness of the codes. Providers can adhere to these codes to demonstrate compliance, and the AI Office will encourage their review and adaptation as needed.\n\nThe summaries are meant to provide helpful explanation but are not legal binding.\n\n## Section 4: Codes of Practice\n\n### 1. The AI Office shall encourage and facilitate the drawing up of codes of practice at Union level in order to contribute to the proper application of this Regulation, taking into account international approaches.\n\n### 2. The AI Office and the Board shall aim to ensure that the codes of practice cover at least the obligations provided for in Articles 53 and 55, including the following issues:\n\n- (a) the means to ensure that the information referred to in [Article 53(1)](/en/ai-act/article-53), points (a) and (b), is kept up to date in light of market and technological developments;\n- (b) the adequate level of detail for the summary about the content used for training;\n- (c) the identification of the type and nature of the systemic risks at Union level, including their sources, where appropriate;\n- (d) the measures, procedures and modalities for the assessment and management of the systemic risks at Union level, including the documentation thereof, which shall be proportionate to the risks, take into consideration their severity and probability and take into account the specific challenges of tackling those risks in light of the possible ways in which such risks may emerge and materialise along the AI value chain.\n\n### 3. The AI Office may invite all providers of general-purpose AI models, as well as relevant national competent authorities, to participate in the drawing-up of codes of practice. Civil society organisations, industry, academia and other relevant stakeholders, such as downstream providers and independent experts, may support the process.\n\n### 4. The AI Office and the Board shall aim to ensure that the codes of practice clearly set out their specific objectives and contain commitments or measures, including key performance indicators as appropriate, to ensure the achievement of those objectives, and that they take due account of the needs and interests of all interested parties, including affected persons, at Union level.\n\n### 5. The AI Office shall aim to ensure that participants to the codes of practice report regularly to the AI Office on the implementation of the commitments and the measures taken and their outcomes, including as measured against the key performance indicators as appropriate. Key performance indicators and reporting commitments shall reflect differences in size and capacity between various participants.\n\n### 6. The AI Office and the Board shall regularly monitor and evaluate the achievement of the objectives of the codes of practice by the participants and their contribution to the proper application of this Regulation. The AI Office and the Board shall assess whether:\n   - (i) they cover all aspects required by Articles 53(1)(a)-(f).\n   - (ii) they address all relevant issues.\n   - (iii) they include sufficient details.\n   - (iv) they are proportionate.\n   - (v) they are adapted appropriately when new technical developments occur.\n   - (vi) they have been reviewed by a representative group.\n   - (vii) they have been evaluated by a representative group.\n   - (viii) there has been regular communication with affected persons throughout each stage.\n   - (ix) there is transparency regarding how decisions were made.\n   - (x) there is consultation with affected persons before making major changes.\n   - (xi) there is cooperation with competent authorities on enforcement matters.\n   - (xii) there is effective supervision over compliance with provisions requiring human oversight.\n\nThe Commission may approve a code based on an evaluation conducted according to a procedure defined by Council Regulations.\n\n### 7. The AI Office may invite all providers of general-purpose AI models to adhere to one or more approved codes if they declare explicitly their interest to join them.\n\n### 8. The AI Office shall take necessary steps for reviewing existing approved codes periodically until they remain adequate after five years from approval or upon request by participating organizations or individuals who believe that it should be reviewed or revised.\n\nIf no response is received within three months from receiving a written request from a participant or another person entitled under <a href=\"/en/ai-act/article-98\" class=\"ecl-link\">Article&nbsp;98(2)</a> requesting such review or revision,\nthe Commission may decide on its own initiative that a code must be reviewed or revised if it appears inadequate after five years from approval or if it does not meet expectations expressed by participants who participated in its development through feedback mechanisms specified in <a href=\"/en/ai-act/article-98\" class=\"ecl-link\">Article&nbsp;98(2).</a>\n\n### Relevant recitals\n\n- [Recital 116](/en/ai-act/recital-116)\n- [Recital 117](/en/ai-act/recital-117)\n- [Recital 135](/en/ai-act/recital-135)\n- [Recital 165](/en/ai-act/recital-165)\n\n### Other resources\n\n[The General-Purpose AI Code of Practice](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/contents-code-gpai)\n\nView\n```",
