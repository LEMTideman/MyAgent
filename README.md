# MyAgent

This repository is part of an online course on Agentic AI by Alexey Grigorev.  
The goal of the project is to learn by building a multi-agent workflow for answering questions related to AI regulation, with a focus on the European Union's AI Act.

This is a learning and experimentation project. The database includes YouTube video transcripts, PDF documents on AI regulation from multiple sources, official material from the European Commission website. Data is collected from publicly available internet sources and used solely for educational purposes.
