# Agentic AI for AI Act Compliance Support
In the context of the [AI engineering course by Alexey Grigorev](https://maven.com/alexey-grigorev/from-rag-to-agents), I am developing a multi-agent workflow for answering questions related to AI regulation, with a focus on the European Union's AI Act. My database includes YouTube video transcripts, PDF documents on AI regulation from multiple sources (e.g. arXiv, Substack), and official material from the European Commission website. Data is collected from publicly available internet sources and used solely for educational purposes.
