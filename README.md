# MyAgent

This repository is part of an online course on **Agentic AI** by Alexey Grigorev.  
The goal of the project is to learn by building a **multi-agent workflow** for answering questions related to **AI regulation**, with a focus on the **EU AI Act**.

This is a **learning and experimentation project**, not a production system.  
Data includes YouTube video transcripts, PDF documents on AI regulation from multiple sources, official material from the European Commission website. 
Data is collected from publicly available internet sources and used solely for educational purposes.
